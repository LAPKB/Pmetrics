# Comparing models 

Let's compare model 1 and model 2.   You can compare any number of models. Type `?PM_compare` for help. All models must already be loaded either with `PM_load` or assigning the result of `$fit`, e.g., `run1 <- mod1$fit(...)`.

```{r}
PM_compare(run1, run2)
```

This will open an html window in your browser with detailed comparisons between the models.
