This is the directory where R expects to find files and where it will save output files. There are two ways to do this.\n\n#### Global working directory change\nYou can set your working directory with the `r r_help(\"base\", \"setwd\", \"getwd\")` function. \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\nsetwd(\"/path/to/your/project/directory\") # Mac and Linux users\nsetwd(\"C:/path/to/your/project/directory\") # Windows users\n```\n\n**Windows users:** Make sure that you separate directories with a forward slash \"/\" or double backslashes \"\\\\\". Unfortunately, Windows is the only OS that uses backslashes \"\", so R conforms to Unix/Linux style with the forward slash. If you copy the example below, make sure to change the path to one that exists on your computer.\n\n#### Local path specification\nYou can also specify the path in a variable and use it in `r pmetrics()` functions without changing the working directory.\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: true\nwd <- \"/path/to/your/project/directory\" # Mac and Linux users\nwd <- \"C:/path/to/your/project/directory\" # Windows users\ndat <- PM_data$new(data = file.path(wd, \"data\", \"mydata.csv\"))\n```\n\n💡 The `r r_help(\"base\", \"file.path\")` function creates file paths that are compatible with your operating system.\n\n### Workflow\n\nThe typical workflow for using `r pmetrics()` is as follows:\n\n1.  Create a `r gh_help(\"PM_data\")` object.\n2.  Create a `r gh_help(\"PM_model\")` object.\n3.  Fit the model to the data with the `$fit()` method of the model object. This returns a `r gh_help(\"PM_result\")` object, which is also saved to the hard drive and can be loaded later with the `r gh_help(\"PM_load\")` function.\n4.  Examine the results with `r gh_help(\"PM_result\")` methods and functions and revise as needed to improve the model fit. This chiefly means using the `$update()` method to change the model or manually editing it.\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| eval: true\nflowchart LR\n\nsubgraph RSession[\" \"]\n  direction TB\n  DATA[\"PM_data\"]\n  MODEL[\"PM_model\"]\n  RESULT[\"PM_result\"]\nend\n\nDISK[(\"Hard Drive\")]\n\nDATA --> MODEL\nMODEL -- \"$fit()\" --> RESULT\nRESULT -- \"$update()\" --> MODEL\nDISK -- \"PM_load()\" --> RESULT\nRESULT --> DISK\n\nclassDef blue fill:#2f6db6,stroke:#184a8b,color:#fff;\nclassDef orange fill:#c7662b,stroke:#8a3f18,color:#fff;\nclassDef disk fill:#d2d3d7,stroke:#7f8084,color:#000;\n\nclass DATA,MODEL blue;\nclass RESULT orange;\nclass DISK disk;\n\nstyle RSession fill:#e9f0ff,stroke:#9ab0d6,stroke-width:1px,rx:2,ry:2\n\n```\n\n\n### Data objects\n\nPmetrics always needs data and a model to run, so let's create a new data object.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\nexData <- PM_data$new(data = \"../Examples/src/ex.csv\")\n```\n\n`r pmetrics()` standardizes the data, checks for errors, and provides an error and attempted fix report fo any found.\n\nYou can look at a .csv data file directly by opening it in a spreadsheet program like Excel, or a text editor.\n\n`exData` is an `r r_help(\"R6\", \"R6\", \"R6Class\")` object, which means that contains both data and methods to process that data.\n\n```{r}\nexData # prints the object, usually to the terminal, but in this case to a rendered \"lite\" spreadsheet\nexData$data # contains your original data\nexData$standard_data # contains the standardized and validated data\nexData$summary() # prints the summary of the data to the terminal\n```\n\nMost `r pmetrics()` objects are R6 objects, so you can use the `$` operator to access their data and methods. Many of them have a `summary()` method that prints a summary of the object to the console and a `plot()` method that creates a plot of the object. See `r gh_help(\"PM_data\")` for more information on the `PM_data` class and its methods.\n\n**Note:** We recognize that many users are familiar with the \"S3 framework\" in R, which uses functions like `summary(object)` and `plot(object)`. To comply with better programming standards, `r pmetrics()` uses the R6 framework. However, we have provided S3 methods for most functions, so you can use `summary(object)` and `plot(object)` if you prefer.\n\n```{r}\n# S3 method to summarize data\nsummary(exData)\n```\n\n`PM_data` has a `plot()` method that creates a plot of the data. See `r gh_help(\"plot.PM_data\")`  for more information.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nexData$plot() \n```\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false\np <- exData$plot()\nplotly::plotly_build(p) #needed to display in output\n```\n\n### Model objects\n\nYou can specify a model by reading a file or directly as a list object in R. We'll do both.\n\nThe following code creates the same model as in `/src/model.txt` file. See further [model details](https://lapkb.github.io/Pmetrics/articles/models.html) on creating models in R compared to text files. The advantage of creating them in R is that one does not need to copy model files into folders to provide necessary inputs.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: mod1_def\n#| eval: true\nmod1 <- PM_model$new(\n  pri = list(\n    Ka = ab(0.1, 0.9),\n    Ke = ab(0.001, 0.1),\n    V = ab(30, 120),\n    lag1 = ab(0, 4)\n  ),\n  cov = list(\n    wt = interp(),\n    africa = interp(\"none\"),\n    age = interp(),\n    gender = interp(\"none\"),\n    height = interp()\n  ),\n  eqn = function(){\n    two_comp_bolus\n  },\n  lag = function(){\n    lag[1] = lag1\n  },\n  out = function(){\n  Y[1] = X[2]/V\n  },\n  err = list(\n    proportional(5, c(0.02, 0.05, -0.0002, 0))\n  )\n)\n```\n\nWhen you execute the above code in your own script or Quarto document, you will see a message indicating that the model has compiled.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\nmod1 # prints the model object\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| message: false\n\nmod1$plot() \n```\n\nWe have another file \"model.txt\" that contains the old representation of the same model we coded above, let's take a look at it.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\nsystem(\"cat ../Examples/src/model.txt\")\n```\n\nYou can also open it in a text editor.\n\n`PM_model$new()` also accepts the path to a model file to create the same model using the file.\n\n```{r}\nmod1b <- PM_model$new(\"../Examples/src/model.txt\")\nmod1b # look at it\n```\n\nPM_model provides a method to update the different elements of a model, for example:\n\n```{r}\nmod1b$update(\n  pri = list(\n    ka = ab(0.001, 5)\n))\n```\n\nIt is case sensitive, so ka is different from Ka. To remove a parameter, set it to NULL.\n\nTo copy a model use the `$clone()` method.\n\n```{r}\nmod1b <- mod1$clone()\n```\n\nSimply using `mod1b <- mod1` will cause `mod1b` to be changed if `mod1` is changed, as R6 objects use reference semantics. For more details you can refer to [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html), Section 14.4.\n\nLastly, `r pmetrics()` has a model building app!\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nbuild_model() #start from scratch\nbuild_model(exData) #start with data to match covariates\nbuild_model(mod1) #start with a model and update it\n```\n\n### Fit the model to the data\n\nTo keep everything tidy, we are working in a folder specifically to store the runs. We are specifying the path in the call to `$fit()` rather than globally changing the working directory.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nrun1 <- mod1$fit(data = exData, run = 1, overwrite = TRUE, path = \"../Examples/Runs\") \n```\n\nThe `r gh_help(\"PM_model\")` class has a `$fit()` method that fits the model to the data.\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false\nrun1 <- NPex\n```\n\nAfter the run is complete the results are returned to the assigned object, here 'run1'. However, if you want to load the results later, you can use the `PM_load()` function. Runs will be sequentially numbered as /1, /2, /3,... in your working directory.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nrun1 <- PM_load(1, path = \"../Examples/Runs\") # load the results from run 1 if returning to this script later\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":false,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"include-in-header":["copy-all-code.html"],"embed-resources":true,"output-file":"NPAG.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
