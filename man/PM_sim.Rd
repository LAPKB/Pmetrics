This object is created after a successful run of the simulator.
}
\details{
There are two methods of creating a PM_sim object.
\itemize{
\item \strong{PM_result$sim()}
\item \strong{PM_sim$new()}
}

They return fully parsed simulator output as \link{PM_sim} objects in R. Details
can be found in the documentation for \verb{$new} method below.

\examples{

## ------------------------------------------------
## Method `PM_sim$new`
## ------------------------------------------------

\dontrun{
# Load results of NPAG run
run1 <- PM_load(1)

# Two methods to simulate
# The first uses the population prior, data, and model in run1, with "..."
# as additional parameters passed to the simulator, e.g. limits, nsim, etc.

sim1 <- run1$sim(...)

# The second uses the population prior and model in run1, and a new template
# data file in the working directory

sim2 <- PM_sim$new(poppar = run1, data = "newfile.csv", ...)

# These methods are entirely interchangeable. The first can accept a different
# data template. The difference is that poppar must be explicitly
# declared when using PM_sim$new. This makes it the method to use when poppar
# is derived from the literature.

# An example of a manual prior
# make 1 lognormal distribution for each parameter
weights <- 1
mean <- log(c(0.7, 0.05, 100))
cov <- matrix(rep(0, length(mean)**2), ncol = length(mean))
diag(cov) <- (c(0.15, 0.15, 0.15) * mean)**2
# make the prior for the simulation
poppar <- list(weights = weights, mean = mean, mat = cov)

# run simulation, assuming temp1.csv and model.txt are in working directory

sim1 <- PM_sim$new(poppar, "temp1.csv",
  nsim = 15, model = "model.txt", include = 1:4, limits = NA,
  noise = list(out = list(coeff = c(0.02, 0.1, 0, 0)))
)

# alternatively, load the model first

mod <- PM_model$new("model.txt")

# and then simulate

sim2 <- mod$sim(poppar = poppar, data = "temp1.csv",
   nsim = 15, include = 1:4, limits = NA,
   noise = list(out = list(coeff = c(0.02, 0.1, 0, 0)))
)

\section{Public fields}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="r6-fields">}}
\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{A list of class \emph{PM_sim} that contains the following elements.
\itemize{
\item \strong{obs} Observations for all simulated templates as a data frame with these columns:
\itemize{
\item \emph{id} Template ID, corresponding to the ID in the template data file
\item \emph{nsim} The simulated profile number, from 1 to the value for \code{nsim}
specified when the simulation was run.
\item \emph{time} Time of the simulated observation.
\item \emph{out} The simulated observation.
\item \emph{outeq} The output equation number.
}
\item \strong{amt} Compartment amounts for each simulated template as a data frame with these columns:
\itemize{
\item \emph{id} As for \code{obs}.
\item \emph{nsim} As for \code{obs}.
\item \emph{time} As for \code{obs}.
\item \emph{out} The simulated amount.
\item \emph{comp} The compartment number that contains the \code{out} amount.
}
\item \strong{parValues}  A data frame with retained simulated parameter
values after discarding any due to truncation limits. The data frame has these columns:
\itemize{
\item \emph{id} This column is only present if \code{usePost = TRUE}, since in that case
the \code{nsim} profiles for each template are created by sampling from a different prior
joint parameter probability distribution for each template. When \code{usePost = FALSE},
the same prior is used for every template, so there is no \code{id} column.
\item \emph{nsim} The simulation number, from 1 to the value for \code{nsim} specified when the simulation was run.
\item a column for each random parameter in the model with the simulated values
}
\item \strong{totalSets} When \code{usePost = FALSE}, the number of all simulated parameter values needed to obtain the
requested number of simulated sets within any \code{limits} specified. When \code{usePost = TRUE},
a data frame with the same number for each template in the \code{data} file, since each template
is simulated from a different prior distribution (see \code{parValues:id} above).
\item \strong{totalMeans} If \code{usePost = FALSE}, this is a vector with the means of
all simulated parameter values, including those discarded for being outside
\code{limits}. If \code{usePost = TRUE}, this is a data frame of vectors, one for each template in the \code{data} file,
and an \code{id} column to identify the template in the \code{data} source.
This can be useful to check against the original means in \code{poppar}, since the
mean of the \code{parValues} may be different due to truncation.
\item \strong{totalCov} Similar to \code{totalMeans}, either a single covariance matrix
for all simulated parameter values when \code{usePost = FALSE} . If \code{usePost = TRUE},
this is a data frame of such matrices, one for each template in the \code{data} file,
and an \code{id} column to identify the template in the \code{data} source.
Again, this can be useful as a check against the original covariance in \code{poppar}.

\subsection{Arguments}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="arguments">}}
\describe{
\item{\code{poppar}}{One of four things:
\enumerate{
\item A \link{PM_result} object containing the final population parameter
distribution from a model run, a model object, and a data object.
The model object may be replaced by a different \link{PM_model}, as
long as the primary parameters are the same as the original model.
The data object may also be replaced (and often is) by a different \link{PM_data}
object compatible with the model.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{run1 <- PM_load(1) # load the PM_result object
sim1 <- run1$sim(...) # replace model and data in run1 if desired; 
#must be compatible with model and data in run1

mod <- PM_model$new("model.txt") # or use a model object
sim2 <- mod$sim(poppar = run1, data = "newdata.csv", ...) 
# poppar and data necessary, model obtained from mod
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\item Population prior parameters as a \link{PM_final} object found in
\code{PM_result$final}.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{run1 <- PM_load(1) # load the PM_result object
sim1 <- PM_sim$new(poppar = run1$final, model = newmodel, data = newdata, ...) 
# model and data necessary

mod <- PM_model$new("model.txt") # or use a model object
sim2 <- mod$sim(poppar = run1$final, data = "newdata.csv", ...) 
# poppar and data necessary, model obtained from mod
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\item The name of a previously saved simulation via the \verb{$save} method. The
file will be loaded. This filename should have the ".rds" extension, e.g. \code{sim1 <- PM_sim$new("sim.rds")}.
\item A manually specified prior as a list containing the following named items:
\itemize{
\item \strong{wt} vector of weights (probabilities) of sampling from each distribution. If missing, assumed to be 1.
\item \strong{mean} a list of mean parameter values. Each element of the list should be named with the parameter name and be a
vector of length equal to the number of distributions. See details below.
\item \strong{sd} an optional named list of overall standard deviations for each parameter, considering parameters as unimodally distributed,
i.e. there should only be one value for each parameter, regardless of the number of distributions.
\code{sd} is only needed if a correlation matrix is specified, which will be converted to a covariance matrix.
\item \strong{ONE} of the following matrices:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{cor} A square matrix of the overall correlations between parameters, again
considered as unimodally distributed, i.e. there should only be one correlation matrix regardless of the number of distributions.
If a correlation matrix is specified, the \code{sd} element is required to calculate the covariance matrix.
\item \strong{cov} A square matrix of the overall covariances between parameters, again
considered as unimodally distributed, i.e. there should only be one covariance matrix regardless of the number of distributions.
If a covariance matrix is specified, the \code{sd} element is unnecessary, since the diagonals of the covariance matrix are the variances
or squared standard deviations.
}
}

If only one distribution is to be specified the
\code{wt} vector can be ommitted or should be \code{wt = 1}. If multiple
distributions are to be sampled, the \code{wt} vector should be of
length equal to the number of distributions in \code{mean} and the values of \code{wt} should sum to 1,
e.g. \code{wt = c(0.25, 0.05, 0.7)}.  The \code{mean} element should be a list
of elements, named for the parameters, with vectors of values equal to the number of terms in \code{wt}.
If \code{cor} is used,
Pmetrics will use the \code{sd} element to calculate the covariance matrix. The
covariance matrix will be divided by the number of distributions, i.e. \code{length(wt)},
and applied to each distribution.

Examples:
\itemize{
\item Single distribution:
}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{poppar = list(wt = 1, 
              mean = list(ke = 0.5, v = 100), 
              cov = matrix(c(0.04, 2.4, 2.8, 400), nrow = 2))  # sd not required because cov specified 
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\itemize{
\item Multiple distributions:
}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{poppar = list(wt = c(0.1, 0.15, 0.75), # 3 distributions that sum to 1
              mean = list(ke = c(2, 0.5, 1), v = c(50, 100, 200)), # 3 values for each parameter
              sd = list(ke = 0.2, v = 20), # overall sd, ignoring multiple distributions
              cor = matrix(c(1, 0.6, 0.7, 1), nrow = 2)) # sd required because cor specified
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}}

\item{\code{model}}{Name of a suitable \link{PM_model} object or a model file template
in the working directory. If missing, and \code{poppar} is a \link{PM_result},
the model within the \verb{$model} field of the \link{PM_result} object will be used.
If \code{model} is missing and \code{poppar} is not a \link{PM_result}, then
Pmetrics will attempt to load a model file in the working directory
called "model.txt" as the default name.}

\item{\code{data}}{Either a \link{PM_data} object or a character vector
with the file name of a Pmetrics data file in the working directory
that contains \strong{template} regimens and observation times.
The value for outputs can be coded as any number(s) other than -99.  The
number(s) will be replaced in the simulator output with the simulated
values. Outputs equal to -99 will be simulated as missing. If \code{data} is
missing, and \code{poppar} is a \link{PM_result},
the data within the \verb{$data} field of the \link{PM_result} object will be used.
If \code{data} is missing and \code{poppar} is not a \link{PM_result}, then
Pmetrics will attempt to load a data template file in the working directory
called "data.csv" as the default name.}

\item{\code{limits}}{If limits are specified, each simulated parameter set that
contains a value outside of the limits will be ignored and another set will
be generated.  Four options exist for limits.
\itemize{
\item The default \code{NULL} indicates that no limits are to be applied to simulated parameters.
\item The second option is to set \code{limits} to \code{NA}. This will use the
parameter limits on the primary parameters that are specified in the \link{PM_model} object.
\item The third option is a numeric vector of length 1 or 2, e.g. \code{limits = 3} or
\code{limits = c(0.5, 4)}, which specifies what to multiply the columns of the parameter limits in the
model file.  If length 1, then the lower limits will be the same as in the
model file, and the upper limits will be multiplied by value specified.  If
length 2, then the lower and upper limits will be multiplied by the
specified values.  If this option is used, \code{poppar} must be a
\code{PM_final} object.
\item The fourth option for limits is a fully
customized data frame or list of limits for simulated values for each parameter which
will overwrite any limits in the model file.  If specified, it should be a
data frame or list with columns or elements, respectively, "par", "min", "max".
For example, use a PM_final$ab object, or a code it like
\code{limits = list(par = c("Ka", "Ke", "V"), min = c(0.1, 0.1, 10), max = c(5, 5, 200))} or
\code{limits = data.frame(par = c("Ka", "Ke", "V"), min = c(0.1, 0.1, 10), max = c(5, 5, 200))} or
\code{limits = tibble::tibble(par = c("Ka", "Ke", "V"), min = c(0.1, 0.1, 10), max = c(5, 5, 200))}.
Each of these specifies custom limits for 3 parameters named Ka, Ke, and V,
with limits of (0.1, 5), (0.1, 5) and (10, 200), respectively.  The last example uses tibbles, the
tidyverse equivalent of data frames.
}

Means and covariances of the total number of simulated sets will be returned to
verify the simulation, but only those sets within the specified limits will
be used to generate output(s) and the means and covariances of the retained
sets may (and likely will be) different than those specified by
\code{poppar}.}

\item{\code{split}}{Boolean operator controlling whether to split an NPAG
\link{PM_final} object into one distribution per support point, with means
equal to the vector of parameter values for that point, and covariance
equal to the population covariance divided by the number of support points.
Default for NPAG \link{PM_final} objects is \code{TRUE}, otherwise
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{\code{include}}{A vector of subject IDs in the \code{data} to iterate
through, with each subject serving as the source of an independent
simulation.  Default is \code{NA} and all subjects in the data file will be used.}

\item{\code{exclude}}{A vector of subject IDs to exclude in the simulation, e.g.
\code{exclude = c(4, 6:14, 16:20)}. Default is \code{NA} and
all subjects in the data file will be used, i.e. none excluded.
Using both \code{include} and \code{exclude} criteria may result in conflicts.}

\item{\code{nsim}}{The number of simulated profiles to create, per subject.  Default
is 1000.  Entering 0 will result in one profile being simulated from each
point in the non-parametric prior (for NPAG final objects only).}

\item{\code{predInt}}{The interval in fractional hours for simulated predicted
outputs at times other than those specified in the template \code{data}.
The default is 0, which means there will be simulated outputs only at times
specified in the data file (see below).  Values greater than 0 result in
simulated outputs at the specified value, e.g. every 15 minutes
for \code{predInt = 0.25} from time 0 up to the maximal time in the template file,
per subject if nsub > 1.  You may also specify \code{predInt} as a vector
of 3 values, e.g. \code{predInt = c(1, 4, 1)}, similar to the R command
\link{seq}, where the first value is the start time, the second is
the stop time, and the third is the step value.  Finally, you can have
multiple such intervals by specifying \code{predInt} as a list of such
vectors, e.g. \code{predInt = list(c(0, 24, 1), c(72, 96, 1))}.  Outputs for times
specified in the template file will also be simulated. To simulate outputs
\emph{only} at the output times in the template data (i.e. EVID=0 events),
use \code{predInt = 0}, which is the default. Note that the maximum number of
predictions is 594, so the prediction interval must be sufficiently long to
accommodate this for a given number of output equations and total time to
simulate over.  If \code{predInt} is set so that this cap is exceeded,
predictions will be truncated.}

\item{\code{covariate}}{Pmetrics can simulate values for some/all covariates
declared in the \code{cov} block of the \link{PM_model}.
This argument is a list with the following named elements.
\itemize{
\item \strong{cov} Optional if \code{poppar} is a \link{PM_result} object, but required if
\code{poppar} is a \link{PM_final} object or a manually specified prior, e.g., with values
obtained from the literature.
\item \strong{mean} Required only if \code{poppar} is a manually specified prior, optional otherwise.
\item \strong{sd} Required only if \code{poppar} is a manually specified prior, optional otherwise.
\item \strong{limits} Optional in all cases.
\item \strong{fix} Optional in all cases.
}

The simplest example is when simulating covariates from a \link{PM_result}:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{run1 <- PM_load(1)
run1$sim(..., covariate = list())`
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Details on each element are below.

\code{cov}

This element specifies the source of the correlation matrix for
covariate values and if possible model primary parameters, i.e., those
in the \code{pri} block of the model.
In the first two cases below, Pmetrics will use this \code{covariate$cov}
object to calculate the correlation
matrix between all covariates and Bayesian posterior parameter values.
In the third case, there is no way to calculate the correlations
between parameters and covariates, so Pmetrics only calculates the covariate correlations.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Case 1}.  If \code{poppar} is a \link{PM_result}, Pmetrics will use the \verb{$cov} field
within that object to obtain covariate means, standard deviations (sd), and
correlations among covariates and parameter values. In this case, you can omit this
element of the \code{covariate} list. See the example above.
\item \strong{Case 2}.  If \code{poppar} is a \link{PM_final}, you will need to supply the name of a \link{PM_result}
or \link{PM_cov} object as the value for this element so that Pmetrics can calculate covariate
means, sd, and correlations.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{run1 <- PM_load(1)
sim1 <- PM_sim$new(poppar = run1$final, covariate = list(cov = run1$cov), model = run1$model, data = "newdata.csv")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
\item \strong{Case 3}.  If \code{poppar} is a manually specified prior, or you wish to simulate covariates
not in the original model, you must provide a
covariance or correlation matrix between the covariates. In this case, it is only possible to
calculate correlations between covariates from the matrix and not between parameters and correlations,
since they are unknown. The \verb{$mean} and optionally the
\verb{$sd} elements of the \code{covariate} list specified below are also required to complete the necessary
information for simulation. Similar to \code{poppar}, if \verb{$sd} is missing, the the \code{cov} object is treated as a covariance matrix,
otherwise it is treated as a correlation matrix.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{corMat <- matrix(c(1, .98, .98, 1), nrow = 2) # correlation matrix for age and wt, for example
covariate <- list(cov = corMat, mean = list(age = 9, wt = 32), sd = list(age = 5.5, wt = 18.8)) # note the named lists for mean and sd, and cov is treated as a correlation matrix

covMat <- matrix(c(30.25, 101.33, 101.33, 353.44), nrow = 2)
covariate <- list(cov = covMat, mean = list(age = 9, wt = 32)) # equivalent covariance matrix, and sd is not required
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\code{mean}

A named list that specifies the mean
for one or more of the covariates in your model. If you are simulating in Case 1 or 2
above, \code{mean} is optional and allows you to use a different mean value than was in your
model-building population. For example, the population may have had a mean weight of
30 kg, but \code{covariate = list(..., mean = list(wt = 70))} allows you to simulate
weight with a mean of 70. If this
argument is missing then the mean covariate values in the population will
be used for simulation. The same applies to any covariates that are not
named in this list.

In Case 3, \code{mean} is required and must be a named list with the names
of the covariates in the correlation matrix, and the values as the mean values for
those covariates. See the example in \code{cov} above under Case 3.

Examples:
\itemize{
\item Using a \link{PM_result} as poppar: \code{PM_sim$new(poppar = run1, covariate = list())}.
Here we don't need to specify \code{cov} because it is already in the \link{PM_result} \code{run1}. We are
not re-centering or otherwise modifying the covariates, so \code{covariate} can be an empty list.
\item Using a \link{PM_final} as poppar: \verb{PM_sim$new(poppar = run1$final, covariate = list(cov = run1$cov, mean = list(wt = 50))}.
Here we need to specify \code{cov} because it is not in the \link{PM_final} object. Futhermore, we want to recenter the
mean values, so we add the \verb{$mean} element.
\item Using a manually specified covariate correlation matrix:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{corMat <- matrix(c(1, .98, .98, 1, nrow = 2) # correlation matrix for age and wt
covariate <- list(cov = corMat, mean = list(age = 9, wt = 32), sd = list(age = 5.5, wt = 18.8)) # mean and sd are required
PM_sim$new(poppar = poppar , covariate = covariate) # covariates will be added to poppar for simulation regardless of the source of poppar
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\code{sd}

This functions just as the `$mean`` argument does, but for standard deviations.

\code{limits} This is a bit different than the limits for population
parameters above. Here,
\code{limits} is similar to \code{mean} and \code{sd} for covariates in
that it is a named list with the minimum and maximum allowable simulated
values for each covariate.  If it is missing altogether, then no limits
will apply.  If it is specified, then named covariates will have the
indicated limits, and covariates not in the list will have limits that are
the same as in the original population.  If you want some to be limited and
some to be unlimited, then specify the unlimited ones as items in this list
with very large ranges. In the examples below, assume that the covariates
age and wt are being simulated.
\itemize{
\item \code{covariate = list(..., limits = list( wt = c(10, 70)))} will limit wt to between 10 and 70 kg.
Since age is also being simulated, it will have the same limits as in the population
under Cases 1 and 2 above. Under Case 3, there is no population value for wt or age, so
wt will be limited and age will be unlimited.
\item \code{covariate = list(..., limits = list( wt = c(10, 70), age = c(0, 200)))} will limit wt to between 10 and 70 kg
and age to between 0 and 200 years, which is effectively no limit. This would only be necessary under
Cases 1 or 2 when age was a covariate in the data and model.
}

\code{fix}

A character vector (not a list) of model covariates to fix and not simulate.
Values in the template data will be used and not simulated.
Example: \code{covariate = list(..., fix = c("wt", "age"))}.}

\item{\code{usePost}}{Boolean, default \code{FALSE}. Only applicable when \code{poppar} contains an
NPAG \link{PM_final} object. If \code{TRUE}, the mean
posterior parameter values and covariances for each subject,
modified by \code{include} or \code{exclude},
in \code{poppar} will be used to simulate rather than the population prior.
The number of subjects in the template \code{data} file must be the same.
Normally one uses the same data file as used to make the model final
parameter distribution in \code{poppar}, but if different templates are
desired, the number must be equivalent to the number of included subjects
from whom the posteriors are obtained.}

\item{\code{seed}}{The seed for the random number generator.  For \code{nsub} > 1,
should be a vector of length equal to \code{nsub}. Shorter vectors will be
recycled as necessary.  Default is -17.}

\item{\code{noise}}{A named list to add noise to most template data fields,
including covariates.
The default is \code{NULL}, which means no noise will be added.
The name of each element in the list should correspond to
a column in the data to which you wish to add noise, typically
\code{time}, \code{dose}, or \code{out}. Note that noise is added to the \code{out} column
\emph{after} simulation but \emph{before} simulation for all other columns. Noise
on the \code{out} column is best thought of as measurement error on the true,
simulated value. Thus, in the simulated output, the \code{amt} values for a given
template id, simulation number, time, and output equation will no longer be
exactly related to the corresponding \code{out} value by the volume term in the model.

These columns may not have noise added: \code{id}, \code{evid}, \code{addl}, \code{ii}, \code{input}, \code{outeq}, \code{c0},
\code{c1}, \code{c2}, and \code{c3}. See \link{PM_data} for further details on these columns.

Each element in the \code{noise} list should be another list with the following arguments.
The \code{coeff} argument is mandatory, and should be the first argument. It can be named or
unnamed. The \code{filter} and \code{mode} arguments are optional and should always be named
in the list.
\itemize{
\item \strong{coeff} Mandatory. A vector of up to 4 coefficients for the noise model. They
correspond to \emph{C0}, \emph{C1}, \emph{C2}, and \emph{C3} for the assay noise model (as in \link{PM_model}).
See the 'mode' argument for details on how these values are used to generate noise.
Examples:
\verb{noise = list(out = list(coeff = c(0.1, 0.1))} or \code{noise = list(dose = list(coeff = c(5, 0.15, -0.01, 0.003)))}.
\item \strong{filter} Optional. A quoted expression to filter the data. For example,
\code{noise = list(dose = list(c(0.1, 0.1), filter = "dose > 0.1"))} or
\code{noise = list(out = list(c(0.05, 0.15), filter = "outeq == 1 & time < 120"))}.
\item \strong{mode} Optional. The mode (method) of the noise. Default is \code{add}. Options are \code{add} or \code{exp}.
\itemize{
\item \code{add} An additive noise model. The new value is generated as
\code{value + noise}, where noise is a random number from a normal distribution,
with mean of 0 and \code{SD = C0 + C1*value + C2*value^2 + C3*value^3}, and \emph{value} is the
original value in each row of the target column.
\item \code{exp} An exponential noise model. The new values is generated as
\code{value * exp(noise)}, where noise is a random number from a normal distribution,
with mean of 0 and \code{SD = C0 + C1*value + C2*value^2 + C3*value^3}, and \emph{value} is the
original value in each row of the target column.

}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}}

\item{\code{makecsv}}{A character vector for the name of the single .csv file to be
made for all simulated "subjects".  If no file extension is included, ".csv"
will be added, e.g. "simout" will become "simout.csv". If an extension is included,
Pmetrics will use it, e.g. "simout.ssv" will save under that name.
If missing, no file will be
made. If a \code{makecsv} filename is supplied, ID numbers will
be of the form \emph{id_nsim}, e.g. 1_1 through 1_10 through for the first
data template id,
2_1 through 2_10 for the second template id, etc. if 10 simulations are made
from each subject in the data template.}

given.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\subsection{Details}{
The Monte Carlo simulator in Pmetrics generates randomly sampled sets of
parameters from the \emph{PRIMARY} block of
a model according to a prior distribution and calculates outputs based upon
a template data file. It is a powerful tool for parametric or
semi-parametric sampling.  There are three ways to execute the simulator.
\itemize{
\item \strong{PM_result$sim()}
\item \strong{PM_model$sim()}
\item \strong{PM_sim$new()}
}

They return fully parsed simulator output as \link{PM_sim} objects in R.
\link{PM_result} or \link{PM_final} objects can easily be used as
the prior distributions for sampling. Prior distributions
may also be manually
specified, useful when simulating from literature values.
Prior distributions may be unimodal-multivariate (parametric
sampling), or multimodal-multivariate (semi-parametric sampling). For
\link{PM_result} or \link{PM_final} priors, this can be accomplished with the \code{split} argument.
For manual priors, the \code{weights} argument in the \code{poppar} list
specifies the weights for each distribution.

It is also possible to simulate with covariates if they are included as part
of the model. By specifying a covariate list argument, Pmetrics will first
calculate the correlation matrix between the covariates and if possible the Bayesian
posterior parameter values for each subject in the population model.  Using
either the mean and standard deviation of each covariate in the population,
or a user-specified mean and/or standard deviation, Pmetrics will then
calculate an augmented covariance matrix to be used in simulations.  Pmetrics
will make a copy of the model file with all covariates moved into the primary
block as parameters to be simulated.

Noise can be applied to most columns in the data template, typically
simulated observations, observation times, dose times, or dose amounts.

Limits on the simulated parameter sets can also be specified using the limits
on primary parameters in the model file or by specifying them manually as an
argument. Limits can also be applied to simulated covariates.

The same model and data structures are used for the simulator as for any
other Pmetrics functions.  In this case, the data object will serve as the
template for the information regarding dosing, covariate values, and
observations.  Template data may have more than one subject in them, in
which case the simulator will use each subject specified by the
\code{include} argument (default is all subjects) to generate \code{nsim}
parameter sets and corresponding observations.

Simulator output is returned as a \link{PM_sim} object.
Output may also be directed to a new Pmetrics .csv data file
using the \code{makecsv} argument.
