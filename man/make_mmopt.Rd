\usage{
make_mmopt(
  poppar,
  model,
  data,
  nsamp = 1,
  weight = list(none = 1),
  predInt = 0.5,
  mmInt,
  outeq = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{poppar}{A \link{PM_result} object created by loading results of a prior NPAG run with \link{PM_load}, which is used to supply population parameters.}

\item{data}{One of two choices which will provide the template dosage and sampling regimens:
\itemize{
\item \link{PM_data} object
\item Character vector with the filename of a Pmetrics data file
that contains template regimens and observation times.
}

If \code{data} is missing, the default value of "data.csv" will be used and Pmetrics will try to open a so-named filed in teh current working directory. In either choice, the value for outputs
can be coded as any number(s) other than -99.  The number(s) will be replaced in the simulator output with the simulated values.}

\item{nsamp}{The number of MM-optimal sample times to compute; default is 1, but can be any number.  Values >4 will take an exponentially longer time.}

\item{weight}{List whose names indicate the type of weighting, and values indicate the relative weight. Values should sum to 1.  Names can be any of the following:
\itemize{
\item \strong{none} The default. MMopt times will be chosen to maximally discriminate all responses at all times.
\item \strong{AUC} MMopt times will be chosen to maximally discriminate AUC, regardless of the shape of the response profile.
\item \strong{max} MMopt times will be chosen to maximally discriminate maximum, regardless of the shape of the response profile.
\item \strong{min} MMopt times will be chosen to maximally discriminate minimum, regardless of the shape of the response profile.
}

Any combination of AUC, max, and min can be chosen.  If "none" is specified, other
weight types will be ignored and the relative value will be set to 1.
For example,\code{list(auc = 0.5,max = 0.5)} or \code{list(auc = 0.2, min = 0.8)}.
The default is \code{list(none = 1)}.}

\item{predInt}{The interval in fractional hours for simulated predicted outputs at times other than those specified in the template \code{data}.
The default is 0.5, which means there will be simulated outputs every 30 minutes from time 0 up
to the maximal time in the template file.  You may also specify \code{predInt}
as a vector of 3 values, e.g. \code{c(1,4,1)}, similar to the R command \link{seq}, where the
first value is the start time, the second is the stop time, and the third is the
step value.  Outputs for times specified in the template file will also be simulated.
To simulate outputs \emph{only} at the output times in the template data (i.e. EVID=0 events), use \code{predInt = 0}.
Note that the maximum number of predictions total is 594, so the interval must be sufficiently large to accommodate this for a given
number of output equations and total time to simulate over.  If \code{predInt} is set so that this cap is exceeded, predictions will be truncated.}

\item{mmInt}{Specify the time intervals from which MMopt times can be selected.
These should only include simulated times specified by \code{predInt}.}

\item{outeq}{Output equation to optimize}

\item{clean}{Boolean parameter to specify whether temporary files made in the
course of the simulation run should be deleted. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
This is primarily used for debugging.}

\item{\dots}{Other parameters to pass to \link{SIMrun}, which are not usually necessary.}
}
\value{
A object of class \emph{MM_opt} with 3 items.
\itemize{
\item \strong{sampleTime} The MM-optimal sample times
\item \strong{bayesRisk} The Bayesian risk of mis-classifying a subject based on the sample times.  This
is more useful for comparisons between sampling strategies, with minimization the goal.
\item \strong{simdata} A \link{PM_sim} object with the simulated profiles
\item \strong{mmInt} A list with the \code{mmInt} values, \code{NULL} if \code{mmInt} is missing.

Method for \link{PM_result} objects to computes 1 or more MM-optimal sampling times.
}
\details{
Based on the multiple-model optimization algorithm, this method computes \emph{nsamp} times where the concentration time profiles are the most separated, thereby minimizing the risk of choosing the incorrect Bayesian posterior for an individual. The algorithm was published as

Models Based on Minimizing Bayes Risk: Application to Voriconazole."
