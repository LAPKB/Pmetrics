\usage{
\method{summary}{PM_pta}(object, at = "intersect", ci = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \link{PM_pta} object}

\item{at}{Which object in the \link{PM_pta} result list to summarize. By default "intersect" if
an intersection is present due to creation of the object with multiple target types, or
1 if no intersection is present, which means only 1 target type was selected. If
"intersect" is present in the object, the default can be overridden with a number to
summarize one of the individual PTAs, e.g. \code{at = 2} to summarize the second PTA rather than the
intersection of all the PTAs.}

\item{ci}{Width of the interval for pharmacodynamic index reporting.  Default is 0.95, i.e. 2.5th to 97.5th percentile.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns (only the first four if \code{at = "intersect"}):
\itemize{
\item \strong{reg_num} is the number of the simulation regimen
\item \strong{label} is the simulation label, for reference
\item \strong{target} is the target for the row, if targets are discrete, not used for simulated targets
\item \strong{type} is the target type for the row, e.g. "auc", "time", "-min", etc.
\item \strong{prop_success} is the proportion of simulated profiles that met the success definition
\item \strong{median} is the median parmacodynamic index (PDI), i.e. the proportion or ratio depending on the target type
\item \strong{lower} is the lower bound of the interval defined by \code{ci}
\item \strong{upper} is the upper bound of the interval defined by \code{ci}
\item \strong{mean} is the mean of the PDI
\item \strong{sd} is the standard deviation of the PDI
\item \strong{min} is the minimum PDI
\item \strong{max} is the maximum PDI

Summarize a Pmetrics Percent Target Attainment Object
}
\details{
Summarize Pharmacodynamic Index (PDI) statistics and success proportions in a \link{PM_pta} object. The PDI is the metric calculated by the target type and target, e.g. AUC/Target,
or \%time>target. Since a PDI cannot be calculated for intersections, summarizing the intersection object only provides the success proportion per simulation/target.
