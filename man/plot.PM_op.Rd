\arguments{
\item{x}{The name of a \link{PM_op} data object
and loaded with \link{PM_load} as a field in a \link{PM_result}, e.g. \code{PM_result$op}.}

\item{line}{Controls characteristics of lines. Unlike
some other Pmetrics plots, for plot.PM_op, \code{line} is a list of
three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{lm}  If set to \code{TRUE} (default) or a list of plotly line attributes,
will generate a linear regression of the form obs ~ pred.
Line attributes will control the appearance of the regression
line and the confidence interval around the line. If set to
\code{FALSE}, no linear regression will be generated. The default
values for the elements of the \code{lm} list, all of which can be
overriden are:
\itemize{
\item \code{ci} Confidence interval around the regression, default 0.95.
\item \code{color} Color of the regression line and the confidence area around
the line, but at opacity = 0.2. Default is "dodgerblue".
\item \code{width }Width of the regression line, default 1.
\item \code{dash} See \code{plotly::schema()}, traces > scatter > attributes >
line > dash > values. Default is "solid".
Example: \code{line = list(lm = list(color = "red", dash = "longdash", width = 2))}
}
\item \code{loess} If set to \code{TRUE} (default is \code{FALSE}) or a list of plotly line attributes,
will generate a loess regression of the form obs ~ pred.
The list elements and default values in the \code{loess} list are the
same as for \code{lm} except the default style is "dash".
Example: \code{line = list(lm = FALSE, loess = TRUE)}
\item \code{ref} If set to \code{TRUE} (default) or a list of plotly line attributes,
will generate a reference line with slope = 1 and intercept = 0.
The default values for the elements of the \code{ref} list are:
\itemize{
\item \code{color} "grey".
\item \code{width} 1.
\item \code{dash} "dot".
Note that there is no \emph{ci} argument for the \emph{ref} list.
Example: \code{line = list(lm = FALSE, loess = TRUE, ref = list(color = "lightgrey"))}
If the \code{line} argument is missing, it will be set to
\code{line = list(lm = TRUE, loess = FALSE, ref = TRUE)}, i.e. there will be a linear
regression with reference line, but no loess regression. However, if \code{resid = T},
the default will become \code{line = list(lm = FALSE, loess = TRUE, ref = TRUE)}, i.e.,
loess regression with reference line, but no linear regression.
}
}}

\item{marker}{Controls the plotting symbol for observations.  This argument maps to the plotly marker object. It can be boolean or a list. \code{TRUE} will plot the marker with default characteristics. \code{FALSE} will suppress marker plotting. If a list, can control many marker characteristics, including overriding defaults. Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to traces > scatter > attributes > marker to see all the ways the marker can be formatted. Most common will be: \itemize{ \item{\code{color}} Marker color. \item{\code{symbol}} Plotting character. See \code{plotly::schema()}, traces > scatter > attributes > marker > symbol > values. \item{\code{size}} Character size in points. \item{\code{opacity}} Ranging between 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). \item{\code{line}} A list of  additional attributes governing the outline for filled shapes, most commonly color and width. }

Example: \code{marker = list(color = "red", symbol = "triangle", opacity = 0.8, line = list(color = "black", width = 2))}
Default is
\code{marker = list(color = orange, shape = "circle", size = 10, opacity = 0.5, line = list(color = black, width = 1))}.
The color of any BLQ points is set to a color 90 degrees different on the color wheel from the
color of the other points using \link{opposite_color} to ensure good contrast. The symbol for BLQ points is fixed to "triangle-down", and
the opacity is fixed to 1. Size is the same as for other points.}

\item{resid}{Boolean operator to generate a plot of weighted prediction error vs. time,
a plot of weighted prediction error vs. prediction. Prediction error is
pred - obs. By default a loess regression will indicate deviation from
zero prediction error.}

\item{icen}{Can be either "median" for the predictions based on medians of\code{pred.type}  parameter value distributions, or "mean".  Default is "median".}

\item{pred.type}{Either 'post' for a posterior object or 'pop' for a population object.  Default is 'post'.}

\item{outeq}{Which output equation to plot. Default is 1.}

\item{block}{Which block to plot, where blocks are defined by dose reset events (EVID = 4) in the data.
Default is missing, which results in all blocks included.}

\item{include}{A vector of subject IDs to include in the plot, e.g. c(1:3,5,15)}

\item{exclude}{A vector of subject IDs to exclude in the plot, e.g. c(4,6:14,16:20)}

\item{mult}{Multiplication factor for y axis, e.g. to convert mg/L to ng/mL}

\item{legend}{Ignored for this plot.}

\item{log}{Boolean operator to plot the y axis in log base 10. This argument maps to the   yaxis type value in the layout object in plotly.  Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to layout > layoutAttributes > yaxis > type.

Example: \code{log = T}}

\item{grid}{Controls grid display. This argument maps to the xaxis and yaxis layout objects in plotly.  Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to layout > layoutAttributes > xaxis or yaxis > gridcolor or gridwidth. It is a Boolean operator. If \code{FALSE}, no grid is plotted.  If \code{TRUE}, the default color \emph{grey} and width 1 will be plotted at  major tick marks. If a list, color and width can be customized.

Examples: \itemize{ \item{\code{grid = F}} \item{\code{grid = list(gridcolor = "black", gridwidth = 2)}} }}

\item{xlab}{Value for x axis label. This argument maps to the the xaxis title element of the layout object in plotly.  It can simply be a character vector of length 1 that specifies the name of  the axis, or it can be a list for greater control. Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to layout > layoutAttributes > xaxis > title to see the ways to customize this axis label. In addition to the plotly attributes, a custom Pmetrics attribute \code{bold}  may be included as a list element, either on its own or within the font list. The default for \code{bold} is \code{TRUE}.

Examples: \itemize{ \item{\code{xlab = "Time (h)"}} \item{\code{xlab = list(text = "Time", bold = F, font = list(color = "red", family = "Arial", size = 10))}} \item{\code{xlab = list(text = "Time", font = list(bold = T))}} }
If missing, will default to "Predicted" for
plots when \code{resid = F} and either "Time" or "Predicted" for residual plots.}

\item{ylab}{Value for y axis label. This argument maps to the the yaxis title element of the layout object in plotly.  See \code{xlab} for details. If \code{xlab} is specified as a list with formatting, and \code{ylab} is simply a character label, then the formatting for the  \code{xlab} will be applied to the \code{ylab}. To format \code{ylab} independently, specify a formatting list as for \code{xlab}.

If missing, will default to "Observed" for
plots when \code{resid = F} and either "Individual weighted residuals" or
"Population weighted residuals" for residual plots, depending on the value of
\code{pred.type}.}

\item{title}{Plot title. This argument maps to the the title layout object in plotly.  It can simply be a character vector of length 1 that specifies the name of  the plot title, or it can be a list for greater control. Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to layout > layoutAttributes > title to see other ways to customize the title using lists as additional arguments. In addition to the plotly attributes, a custom Pmetrics attribute \code{bold}  may be included as a list element. The default for \code{bold} is \code{TRUE}.

Examples: \itemize{ \item{\code{title = "Observed vs. Predicted"}} \item{\code{title = list(text = "Raw Data", font = list(color = "red", family = "Arial", size = 10, bold = T))}} }
Default is to have no title.}

\item{stats}{Add the statistics from linear regression to the plot. If
\code{FALSE}, will be suppressed. Default is \code{TRUE} which results in default format of
\code{list(x= 0.8, y = 0.1, font = list(color = "black", family = "Arial", size = 14, bold = FALSE))}.
The coordinates are relative to the plot with lower left = (0,0), upper right = (1,1). This
argument maps to \code{plotly::add_text()}.}

\item{print}{If \code{TRUE}, will print the plotly object and return it. If \code{FALSE}, will only return the plotly object.}

\item{xlim}{Limits of the x axis as a vector.   This argument maps to the   the xaxis range in the layout object in plotly.  Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to layout > layoutAttributes > xaxis > range.

Example: \code{xlim = c(0,1)}}

\item{ylim}{Limits of the y axis as a vector.   This argument maps to the   the yaxis range in the layout object in plotly.  Use the plotly \code{plotly::schema()} command in the console and navigate to layout > layoutAttributes > yaxis > range.

Example: \code{ylim = c(0,100)}}

\item{...}{Other attributes which can be passed to the layout > xaxis/yaxis  in a plotly plot to further control formatting.  Note that \code{log}, \code{xlab}, \code{ylab}, \code{xlim}, and \code{ylim} are  all controlled by the layout object, but are provided throughout Pmetrics plotly function arguments as shortcuts that map to layout elements.  Therefore, the dots argument should be used to specify other aspects of the  x axis, y axis, or both. See \code{plotly::schema()} layout > layoutAttributes  > xaxis/yaxis for options. To add to single axis, name it as a list.  If attributes are specified without an enclosing xaxis or yaxis list,  they will be applied to both axes.

Examples:  \itemize{ \item{\code{NPex$data$plot(xaxis = list(tickcolor = "black", tickfont = list(family = "Arial", size = 14, color = "black"))) #applies to x axis only}} \item{\code{NPex$data$plot(linecolor = "red", ticks = "inside") #applies to both axes}} }  .}
}
\value{
Plots the object.

Plot PM_op objects
}
\details{
This is a function usually called by the \verb{$plot()} method for \link{PM_op} objects
within a \link{PM_result} to generate a plot of Observed vs. Predicted observations.
The function can be called directly on a \link{PM_op} object. The default
is to generate an observed vs. predicted plot of predictions based on the
median of the Bayesian posterior distributions for each subject.
Missing observations are excluded. Observations reported as BLQ (below the limit of quantification)
are indicated as downward triangles, and colored differently from other observations. They are plotted
at the reported LOQ on the observed axis and the predicted value on the predicted axis. They are not
included in any regression lines or statistics.

Clicking on a point in the plot will highlight all points from that subject. The color of the highlight
is 180 degrees different on the color wheel from the color of the other points (\link{opposite_color}), ensuring good contrast.
Clicking on the plot background will remove the highlighting.
