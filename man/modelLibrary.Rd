\format{
A tibble with the following columns
\itemize{
\item \strong{ncomp} The number of compartments in the model, including any bolus
depo compartment(s).
\item \strong{par} Either "K" for parameterization with rate constants, or "CL" for
clearances.
\item \strong{route} Input route(s)
\item \strong{elim} List of compartment numbers with elimination
\item \strong{mod} the \link{PM_model}
\item \strong{name} Model name in plain English
\item \strong{algebraic} Token indicating algebraic solution. Format is a character
vector of 4 elements:
\itemize{
\item P[]: primary parameters of at least Ke, V, and optionally Ka, KCP and KPC,
e.g. P[Ke,V]
\item B[]: Bolus input compartment numbers, 0 for no bolus, e.g. B[1]
\item R[]: RateIV inputs, 0 for no IV, e.g. R[2]
\item O[]: Output compartments, e.g. O[2]
For example, one compartment IV model with no oral input:
"P[Ke,V], B[0], R[1], O[1]"
}
}
