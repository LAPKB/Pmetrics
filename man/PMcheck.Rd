\title{Check Pmetrics Inputs for Errors}
\usage{
PMcheck(data, model, fix = F, quiet = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The name of a Pmetrics .csv matrix file in the current working directory,
the full path to one not in the current working directory, or a data.frame containing
the output of a previous \code{\link{PMreadMatrix}} command.}

\item{model}{The filename of a Pmetrics model file in the current working directory.  This parameter is optional.
If specified, and the data object has no errors, the model file will be evaluated.}

\item{fix}{Boolean operator; if \code{TRUE}, Pmetrics will attempt to fix errors in the data file.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{quiet}{Boolean operator to suppress printed output.  Default is false.}
}
\value{
If \code{fix=TRUE}, then \code{PMcheck} returns a PMmatrix data object which has been
cleaned of errors as much as possible, displaying a report on the console.
If \code{fix=FALSE}, then \code{PMcheck} creates a file in the working directory called \dQuote{errors.xlsx}.
This file can be opened by Microsoft Excel or any other program that is capable of reading .xlsx files.  This file
contains highlighted areas that are erroneous, with clarifying comments.  You can correct the errors in the file
and then re-save as a .csv file.

When \code{fix=FALSE}, the function also returns a list of objects of class \emph{PMerr}.  Each object is itself a list whose
first object (\code{$msg}) is a character vector with \dQuote{OK} plus a brief description if there is no error, or the error.
The second object (\code{$results}) is a vector of the row numbers that contain that error.
\item{colorder}{The first 14 columns must be named id, evid, time, dur, dose, addl, ii, input, out, outeq, c0, c1, c2, and c3 in that order.}
\item{maxcharCol}{All column names should be less than or equal to 11 characters.}
\item{maxcharID}{All id values should be less than or equal to 11 characters.}
\item{missEVID}{Ensure that all rows have an EVID value.}
\item{missTIME}{Ensure that all rows have a TIME value.}
\item{doseDur}{Make sure all dose records are complete, i.e. contain a duration.}
\item{doseDose}{Make sure all dose records are complete, i.e. contain a dose.}
\item{doseInput}{Make sure all dose records are complete, i.e. contain an input number.}
\item{obsOut}{Make sure all observation records are complete, i.e. contain an output.}
\item{obsOuteq}{Make sure all observation records are complete, i.e. contain and outeq number.}
\item{T0}{Make sure each subject's first time=0.}
\item{covT0}{Make sure that there is an non-missing entry for each covariate at time=0 for each subject.}
\item{timeOrder}{Ensure that all times within a subject ID are monotonically increasing.}
\item{contigID}{Ensure that all subject IDs are contiguous.}
\item{nonNum}{Ensure that all columns except ID are numeric.}
\item{noObs}{Ensure that all subjects have at least one observation, which could be missing, i.e. -99.}
}
\description{
This function will check a .csv file or a data frame containing a
previously loaded .csv file (the output of \code{\link{PMreadMatrix}} for errors
which would cause the analysis to fail.  If a model file is provided, and the data
file has no errors, it will also check the model file for errors.
}
\details{
Either a filename or a data object in memory are accepted as \code{data}.
The format of the .csv matrix file is fairly rigid.
It must have the following features.  Text is case-sensitive.
\itemize{
\item A header in row 1 with the appropriate version, currently \dQuote{POPDATA DEC_11}
\item Column headers in row 2.  These headers are: #ID, EVID, TIME, DUR, DOSE, ADDL, II, INPUT, OUT, OUTEQ,
C0, C1, C2, C3.
\item No cell should be empty.  It should either contain a value or \dQuote{.} as a placeholder.
\item Columns after C3 are interpreted as covariates.
\item All subject records must begin with TIME=0.
\item All dose events (EVID=1) must have entries in ID, EVID, TIME, DUR, DOSE and INPUT.  ADDL and II are optional, but if ADDL is not 0 or
missing, then II is mandatory.
\item All observation events (EVID=0) must have entries in ID, EVID, TIME, OUT, OUTEQ.
If an observation is missing, use \emph{-99}; otherwise use a \dQuote{.} as a placeholder
in cells that are not required (e.g. INPUT for an observation event).
\item If covariates are present in the data, there must be an entry for every covariate at time 0 for each subject.
\item All covariates must be numeric.
\item All times within a subject ID must be monotonically increasing.
\item All subject IDs must be contiguous.
\item All rows must have EVID and TIME values.
\item All columns must be numeric except ID which may be alpha-numeric.
\item All subjects must have at least one observation, which could be missing, i.e. -99.
}

To use this function, see the example below.

After running PMcheck and looking at the errors in the errors.xlsx file, you can fix the
errors manually directly in the errors.xlsx file and resave it as a .csv file.
Alternatively, you could then try to fix the problem(s) with \code{mdata2 <- PMcheck(mdata,fix=T)}.  Note that we are now returning
a PMmatrix data object called mdata2 (hopefully cleaned of errors) rather than the PMerr object returned when \code{fix=FALSE}.
Pmetrics handles each of the errors in the following ways.
\itemize{
\item If the columns are simply out of order, they will be reordered.  If some are missing, the fix must
be done by the user, i.e. manually.
\item All id and covariate values are truncated to 11 characters.
\item Missing observations are set to -99 (not \dQuote{.}).
\item Incomplete dose records are flagged for the user to fix manually.
\item Incomplete observation records are flagged for the user to fix manually.
\item Subjects without an EVID=1 as first event are flagged for the user to fix manually.
\item Subjects with TIME != 0 as first event have dummy dose=0 events inserted at time 0.
\item Subjects with a missing covariate at time 0 are flagged for the user to fix manually.
\item Non-numeric covariates are converted to numeric (via \link{factor}).
\item Non-ordered times are sorted within a subject if there are no EVID=4 events; otherwise the
user must fix manually.
\item Non-contiguous subject ID rows are combined and sorted if there are no EVID=4 events; otherwise the
user must fix manually.
\item Rows missing an EVID are assigned a value of 0 if DOSE is  missing, 1 otherwise.
\item Rows missing a TIME value are flagged for the user to fix manually.
\item Columns that are non-numeric which must be numeric are flagged for the user to fix manually.
These are EVID, TIME, DUR, DOSE, ADDL, II, INPUT, OUT, OUTEQ, C0, C1, C2, and C3.
Covariate columns are fixed separately (see above).
