\arguments{
\item{x}{PM_data object to analyze.}

\item{postPred}{Boolean switch to use the posterior predictions rather than the observed.
concentrations.  Default is \code{FALSE}. Ignored if an IT2B run is
used to supply the raw data file.}

\item{include}{A vector of subject IDs to include in the NCA, e.g. c(1:3,5,15)}

\item{exclude}{A vector of subject IDs to exclude in the NCA, e.g. c(4,6:14,16:20). When \code{postPred} is \code{TRUE}, any subject(s) excluded from the IT2B/NPAG run will be excluded as well.}

\item{input}{The number of the input (e.g. drug) to analyze; default 1.}

\item{icen}{If \code{postPred} is \code{TRUE}, use predictions based on median or mean of each
subject's Bayesian posterior parameter distribution.  Default is "median", but could be "mean".}

\item{outeq}{The number of the output equation to analyze; default 1}

\item{block}{The number of the observation block within subjects, with each block delimited by EVID=4 in the data file; default 1}

\item{start}{The beginning of the time interval to look for doses and observations, e.g. 120.  It can be
a vector to allow for individual start times per subject, e.g. c(120,120,144,168).  If the length of \code{start}
is less than the number of subjects, the last value will be recycled as needed.  If the \code{start} time is not 0 (default),
then it is assumed that steady state (multiple dose) conditions apply.}

\item{end}{Analogous to \code{start}, set this equal to the end of the dosing interval. It too can be a vector, with the last value
recycled as necessary.  Default is \code{Inf}, i.e. all data used.}

\item{first}{Alternative way to specify time interval for NCA by choosing dose number, e.g. 1 or 3.  May be a numeric vector, like \code{start} and \code{end},
e.g. c(1,1,1,3,1,...) to allow for individualization by subject.  The last value will be recycled to ensure length equal to the
number of subjects.  Default is \code{NA}, which means \code{start} will be used.}

\item{last}{The complement to \code{first}, specifying the last dose to end the time interval.  If \code{NA},
which is the default, then the maximum time per subject will be the upper bound of the time interval.
Like \code{first}, \code{last} can be a vector, with the last value recycled as necessary.  Use \code{NA} in the vector
to signify maximum time for that subject.}

\item{terminal}{Number of observations to use for terminal curve fitting (i.e. to estimate \emph{k}).  Default is 3.}

\value{
A dataframe of class \emph{PMnca} with columns
\item{id }{Subject identification}
\item{auc }{Area under the time-observation curve, using the trapezoidal approximation, from time 0 until the second dose,
or if only one dose, until the last observation}
\item{aumc }{Area under the first moment curve}
\item{k }{Slope by least-squares linear regression of the final 3 log-transformed observations vs. time.
If the final 3 concentrations are not decreasing such that linear regression results in a positive slope,
this value and all others that depend on \code{k} will be suppressed.}
\item{auclast }{Area under the curve from the time of the last observation to infinity, calculated as \link{Final obs}/k.
This value will be suppressed if start != 0.}

This value will be suppressed if start!=0.}

\item{tmax }{Time to cmax}
\item{cl }{Clearance, calculated as dose/aucinf}
\item{vdss }{Volume of distribution at steady state, calculated as cl*mrt}

\description{
Performs a non-compartmental analysis from a \code{PM_result} object using
observed concentrations in the raw data
file (\code{PM_result$data$standard_data}) or from an individual
Bayesian posterior predicted
time-observation profiles (\code{PM_result$post$data}) generated automatically after an NPAG run
and loaded with \link{PM_load} .
}
\details{
If concentrations from multiple dose intervals are included in the \code{start}-\code{end} time interval,
\code{makeNCA} will superpose the concentrations using the time after dose.  An error will be generated if
different doses are within this interval as superposition would no longer be valid.

A minimum of 5 concentrations must be available to perform NCA for any given subject.  Fewer than this will
suppress all results for that subject.
