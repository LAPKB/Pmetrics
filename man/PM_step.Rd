\title{Stepwise covariate-parameter regressions}
\usage{
PM_step(x, icen = "median", direction = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A PMcov object which is the \verb{$data} field of a \link{PM_cov} object}

\item{icen}{A character vector to summarize covariate values.  Default is "median", but can also be
"mean".}

\item{direction}{The direction for covariate elmination can be "backward", "forward", or "both" (default).}
}
\value{
A matrix with covariates in the rows and parameters in the columns.  Values for the matrix are the multi-variate P-values.
A value of \code{NA} indicates that the variable was not retained in the final model.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#superseded}{\figure{lifecycle-superseded.svg}{options: alt='[Superseded]'}}}{\strong{[Superseded]}}

This function is largely superseded as it is accessed through the \verb{$step} methods
for \link{PM_result} and \link{PM_cov} objects. There is rarely a need to call it directly
any longer.
}
\details{
It will perform stepwise linear regressions on a \link{PM_cov} object.
Every covariate in the model will be tested in a stepwise linear regression for their relationships
to each parameter in the model.  Bayesian posterior parameters and individual covariates are used.
