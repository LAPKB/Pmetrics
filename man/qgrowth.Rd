\title{Extract CDC pediatric growth charts}
\usage{
qgrowth(
  sex = c("M", "F", "B"),
  percentile = c(5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95),
  agemos = (seq(0, 18) * 12)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sex}{A single quoted character: "M" for males, "F" for
females, or "B" for both.  Default is "B".}

\item{percentile}{An integer vector of the percentile for each age/sex to return.
Default is 50, but could be, for example \code{c(5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95)}.}

\item{agemos}{A vector of ages in months to return.  The default is
\code{seq(0,18)*12}, i.e. 0 to 216 months in increments of 12, which is
1 to 18 years. Values do not have to be multiples of 12.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with columns
\itemize{
\item agemos Age in months
\item ageyrs Age in years
\item wt Weight in kilograms
\item ht Height or length in centimeters
\item bmi Body mass index $kg/m^2$
\item sex The selected sex(es)
\item percentile The selected percentile(s)
}
}
\description{
Will extract height, weight, and BMI for boys, girls or both for a given range of ages in months and percentiles. This can be useful for
simulations in Pmetrics.
