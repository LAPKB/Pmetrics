Bayesian posterior distributions wide given parameter \\(mean(var(EBD))\\) high due sparse uninformative sampling, population variance due variance shrinkage high, .e., individual posterior estimates (EBE) shrink towards population mean. aware, however, Bayesian posterior parameter value distribution given subject sparsely sampled may also single support point variance. Therefore EBD nonparametric assumptions always large uninformative sampling. means shrinkage readily interpretable nonparametric population modeling. alternative consider number support points relative number subjects.
