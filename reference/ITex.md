## Details

This is an R6 Pmetrics
[`PM_result()`](https://lapkb.github.io/Pmetrics_rust/reference/PM_result.md)
object created with
[`PM_load()`](https://lapkb.github.io/Pmetrics_rust/reference/PM_load.md)
after an IT2B run. The run consisted of a model with an absorptive
compartment and a central compartment. There were 4 parameters in the
model: lag time of absorption (Tlag1), rate constant of absorption (Ka),
volume (V) and rate constant of elmination (Ke). There were 20 subjects
in the dataset. The run was 100 cycles long and did not converge.
