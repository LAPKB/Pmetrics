# Parametric and non-parametric modeling and simulation of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic systems.

This package contains functions to run and analyze the output from all
three components of the Pmetrics software suite for population
pharmacometric data analysis:

1.  IT2B (Iterative Two-Stage Bayesian) for parametric models; 2) NPAG
    (Non-parametric Adaptive Grid) for non-parametric models; 3)
    Simulator for semi-parametric Monte-Carlo simulations.
