# Compare NPAG or IT2B runs

**\[deprecated\]**

Compare NPAG or IT2B runs, based on objects loaded by
[PMload](https://lapkb.github.io/Pmetrics_rust/reference/PMload.md),
which is now deprecated, because it loaded Pmetrics objects from a prior
run into user's global environment, which was unsafe programming
practice and caused warnings in CRAN.

## Usage

``` r
PMcompare(...)
```
