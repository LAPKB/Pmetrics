 THE LARGEST D-OPTIMAL TIME FOR RUN 2 WAS          24.00237619    


 THERE IS MORE THAN A 1% DIFFERENCE IN AT LEAST ONE 
 OF THESE PAIRS OF VALUES. THESE DIFFERENCES MAY INDICATE THAT
 THIS ANALYSIS HAS NUMERICAL INSTABILITY PROBLEMS AND/OR THAT 
 THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF D-OPTIMAL TIMES THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY
 EQUALLY GOOD.
