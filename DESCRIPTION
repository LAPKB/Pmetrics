Title: Pmetrics for Population Modeling and Simulation
Type: Package
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
Description: Pmetrics is short for pharmacometrics, the discipline of modeling drug kinetics and effects on biologic systems, including disease progression. Models can be used to simulate novel therapeutic dosing regimens and/or populations, informing trial design and dosing strategies. The package supports primarily non-parametric but also parametric pharmacometric modeling and simulation with functions to run and analyze the output from all three components of the Pmetrics software suite for population pharmacometric data analysis: 1) IT2B (Iterative Two-Stage Bayesian) for parametric models; 2) NPAG (Non-parametric Adaptive Grid) for non-paramametric models; 3) Simulator for semi-parametric Monte-Carlo simulations.
