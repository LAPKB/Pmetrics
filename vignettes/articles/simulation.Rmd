## Performing Simulations

The Pmetrics simulator is a powerful Monte Carlo engine that is smoothly integrated with Pmetrics inputs and 
outputs. Unlike NPAG and IT2B, it is run from within R. No batch file is created or terminal window opened. 
However, the actual simulator is a Fortran executable compiled and run in an OS shell.

To complete a simulator run you must include data and a model object. These can be previously loaded objects with `PM_data()` and `PM_model()` or loaded on the fly by specifying file names of appropriate files in the current working directory, which you can check with `getwd()` and `list.files()`, e.g., .csv for data and .txt for models, at the time of simulation. The model dictates the equations and the data file serves as the template specifying doses, observation times, covariates, etc.

The other mandatory item is a prior probability distribution for all random parameter values in the model. This is referenced by the `poppar` argument, detailed below.

You run the simulator in two ways.

* Use the `$sim()` method for `PM_result()` objects. This takes `poppar` from the `PM_result$final` field and the model from the `PM_result$model` field, so only a data object needs to be specified at minimum. If no data object is specified, it will use the `PM_result$data` as a template, i.e. the same data used to fit the model. An example is below. You don't have to supply the model or `poppar`, because they are included in `run1`, with `poppar` taken from the `run$final` field. Supplying a different `PM_data` object as `dat` allows you to use the model and population prior from `run1` with a different dosing and observation data template. If you omit `dat` in this example, the original data in `run1` would serve as the template.
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
run1 <- PM_load(1)
sim1 <- run1$sim(data = dat, nsim = 100, limits = NA)
```
* Use `PM_sim$new()`. This simulates without necessarily having completed a fitting run previously, i.e., there may be no `PM_result()` object. Here, you manually specify values for `poppar`, `model`, and `data`. These can be other Pmetrics objects, or de novo, which can be useful for simulating from models reported in the literature. An example is below. 
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sim2 <- PM_sim$new(poppar = run2$final, data = dat, model = mod1,...)
```
Now you must include all three of the mandatory arguments: `model`, `data`, and `poppar`. In this case we used the `PM_final()` object from a different run (`run2`) as the `poppar`, but we could also specify `poppar` as a list, for example. See `SIMrun()` for details on constructing a manual `poppar`.
```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
poppar <- list(wt = 1, mean = c(0.7, 100), covar = diag(c(0.25, 900)))
```

Under the hood, both of these calls to the simulator use the <span class="legacy">Legacy</span> `SIMrun()` function, and thus all its arguments are available when using `PM_result$sim(...)` or `PM_sim$new(...)`.

## Model and data details

The structures of the model and data objects when used by the simulator are identical to those used by NPAG and IT2B. Of course, the model primary (random) parameters must match the parameters in the `poppar` argument. Any covariates must match between model and data. The data object contains the template dosing 
and observation history as well as any covariates. Observation values (the `OUT` column) for `EVID=0` events can be 
any number; they will be replaced with the simulated values. However, do not use -99, as this will simulate a 
missing value, which might be useful if you are testing the effects of such values. A good choice for the OUT value 
in the simulator data template is -1 to remind you that it is being simulated, but this choice is optional.

You can have any number of subject records within a data object, each with its own covariate values if applicable. Each 
subject will cause the simulator to run one time, generating as many simulated profiles as you specify from each 
template subject. This is controlled by the `include`, `exclude`, and `nsim` arguments to the simulator (see below). The 
first two specify which subjects in the data object will serve as templates for simulation. The second specifies how 
many profiles are to be generated from each included subject.

## Simulation options

Details of all arguments available to modify simulations are available by typing `?SIMrun` into the R console or reading the documentation for `SIMrun()`. A few are highlighted here.

Simulation from a non-parametric prior distribution (from NPAG) can be
done in one of two ways. The first is simply to take the mean and covariance 
matrix of the distribution and perform a
standard Monte Carlo simulation. This is accomplished by setting `split = FALSE` as an argument. 

The second way is what we call semi-parametric [@goutelle_nonparametric_2022]. In this method, the non-parametric "support points" in the population model, each a
vector of one value for each parameter in the model and the associated
probability of that set of parameter values, serve as the mean of one
multi-variate normal distribution in a multi-modal, multi-variate joint
distribution. The weight of each multi-variate distribution is equal to
the probability of the point. The overall population covariance matrix
is divided by the number of support points and applied to each
distribution for sampling.

Below are illustrations of simulations with a single mean and covariance for two parameters (left, `split = FALSE`), and with multi-modal sampling (right, `split = TRUE`).

```{r fig.show = "hold", out.width = "45%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(c("Images/unibv40.png","Images/multi-bv40.png"))
```
  
Limits may be specified for truncated parameter ranges to avoid extreme
or inappropriately negative values. The simulator will report values for the total number of simulated
profiles needed to generate `nsim` profiles within the specified limits,
as well as the means and standard deviations of the simulated parameters
to check for simulator accuracy.

Output from the simulator can be controlled by further arguments passed to `SIMrun()`. If `makecsv` is supplied, a .csv file with the simulated
profiles will be created with the name as specified by `makecsv`;
otherwise, there will be no .csv file created. If `outname` is supplied,
the simulated values and parameters will be saved in a .txt file whose
name is that specified by `outname`; otherwise the filename will be
"simout". In either case, integers 1 to the number of subjects will be appended to outname
or "simout", e.g. "simout1.txt", "simout2.txt".

## Simulation output

In <span class="r6">R6</span>, simulation output files (e.g. *simout1.txt*, *simout2.txt*) are automatically read by `SIMparse()` and returned as the new `PM_sim()` object that was assigned to contain the results of the simulation. All files will remain on the hard drive. You no longer need to use `SIMparse()` as Pmetrics will do it for you. This is unlike the <span class="legacy">Legacy</span> requirement for you to specifically read the output files from the simulator with `SIMparse()`. 

If you simulated from a template with multiple subjects, you will have a simulation output from each template, and each will have `nsim` profiles. If you wish to combine all the simulations into one `PM_sim()` object, use the argument `combine` in your call to the simulator run methods. It will be passed to `SIMparse()` during the post-simulation processing.

So if our data template has 3 subjects...
``` {r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sim1 <- run1$sim(data = dat) #sim1 is a PM_sim with 3 simulation results
sim2 <- run1$sim(data = dat, combine = TRUE) #sim2 is a PM_sim with combined results
```

`PM_sim()` objects have 6 data fields and 6 methods.

### Data fields

Data fields are accessed with `$`, e.g. `sim1$obs`.

* **amt** A data frame with the amount of drug in each compartment for each template subject at each time.
* **obs** A data frame with the simulated observations for each subject, time and output equation.
* **parValues** A data frame with the simulated parameter values for each subject.
* **totalCov** The covariance matrix of all simulated parameter values, including those that were discarded to be within any `limits` specified.
* **totalMeans** The means of all simulated parameter values, including those that were discarded to be within any `limits` specified.
* **totalSets** The number of simulated sets of parameter values, including those that were discarded to be within any `limits` specified. This number will always be â‰¥ `nsim`.

All of these are detailed further in `SIMparse()`.

### Methods

Methods are accessed with `$` and include parentheses to indicate a function, possibly with arguments e.g. `sim1$auc()` or `sim1$save("sim1.rds")`.

* **auc** Call `makeAUC()` to calculate the area under the curve from the simulated data.
* **pta** Call `makePTA()` to perform a probability of target attainment analysis with the simulated data.
* **plot** Call `plot.PM_sim()` to plot the simulated data.
* **summary** Summarize any data field with or without grouping.
* **save** Save the simulation to your hard drive as an .rds file. Load a previous one by providing the filename as the argument to `PM_sim$new()`.
* **clone** Copy a simulation result.

All of these are detailed further in `PM_sim()`.To apply them to one of the  simulations when there are multiple, use `at` followed by additional arguments to the method to choose the simulation.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sim1$plot(at = 2,...)
```
