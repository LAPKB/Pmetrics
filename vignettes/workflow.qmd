## General Workflow

The user creates the data and model objects at the top. These can come from the hard drive or from within R (dashed arrows). The model file is created in R using
the `PM_model$new()` function and the data file by `PM_data$new()`. When combined using the `$fit()` method
on the compiled model, the analysis is executed. At the end of the run, the hard drive will contain a new numerically named folder, e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., that contains the files which can be loaded into R subsequently using
`PM_load(x)`, replacing `x` with the folder number. `PM_load()` is an alias for `PM_result$new()` because it creates a new `PM_result()` object which contains all the results of a run, and has many assciated methods attached to it for plotting, simulating, etc.

To change model parameters, the model object is updated via `PM_model$update()`.  If  continuing a previous run that did not end, simply use `$fit()` and specify the run number you wish to continue as the `prior` argument to `$fit()`. These scenarios are illustrated below.

```{r echo=T, eval=FALSE, label = workflow_code}
# Run 1 - ensure the data, model files are in the working directory
data1 <- PM_data$new("data.csv")
mod1 <- PM_model$new("model.txt")
res1 <- mod1$fit(data1) # this is a PM_result object

res1 <- PM_load(1) # if returning to script later, use this to load from hard drive

# Run 2 - update Ke range
mod2 <- mod1$clone # create an independent copy
mod2$update(list(pri = list(Ke = ab(0.5, 3))))
run2 <- mod2$fit(data1)


# Run 3 - continue run 2
run3 <- mod2$fit(data = data1, prior = 2)
```

The great advantage of R6 over Legacy is that in R6, you no longer need to spend time copying files from prior run folders, modifying them, and ensuring that they are in the working directory. After the initial creation of the data and model objects, everything can be done in R from memory, although results are still saved to hard drive for later retrieval.
