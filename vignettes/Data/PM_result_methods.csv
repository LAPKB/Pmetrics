Methods,Comments
$new,"This method is not called directly, but new PM_result objects are created using PM_load()"
$plot,"Alternative method to plot objects, e.g. PM_result$plot(""op"") = PM_result$op$plot() = plot(PM_result$op)"
$summary,"Alternative method to summarize objects, e.g. PM_result$summary(""final"") = PM_result$final$summary() = summary(PM_result$final)"
$fit,Fit data using the model in the PM_result object
$auc,"Calculate auc by supplying a src, e.g. PM_result$auc(""op"")"
$report,Regenerate the report
$sim,Simulate using the model in the PM_result object
$save,Save the PM_result object
$validate,Validate by simuation to create VPC or NPDE as a PM_valid object
$step,Stepwise forward/backward linear regression between covariates and model parameter values
$opt,Optimal sampling to create a PM_opt object
