## Creating Models

There are three pathways to creating models in Pmetrics.

* Use the Pmetrics Model Builder app
* Write a model list in R
* Load an existing model text file


Each of these use sections to define the model. In the app, the sections correspond to 
tabs. In the list, they are named elements. In the model file, they are code blocks 
delimited by "\#" and the name of the block.
The sections are largely the same across
the three model pathways, and we'll cover the details in this document.

### Model Builder App

To launch the app, type the following into your console: `build_model()`. 
You can supply a `PM_data` and/or a `PM_model` as optional arguments to
the function, e.g. `build_model(NPex$data)` or `build_model(NPex$model)` or
even `build_model(NPex$data, NPex$model)`. The order of data and/or model
arguments doesn't matter. Pmetrics can figure out which is which.

### Model List

You can write a Pmetrics model list in R. Blocks in the model files which 
were delimited with the "#" character become lists in R6. 
You can also generate a model in the app and copy it as a list to R which can be
used in `PM_model$new(copied_list)`. Once in R, `PM_model` list objects can 
be updated using the `$update()` [method](#update-model). 

### Model Files

The format of the .txt model file has been unchanged since Pmetrics 0.4. You can 
write the file by hand, or use the app to create a model and then save it to a file.
Once you have a file, it can be loaded in to R with `PM_model$new("file")`.

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
mod1 <- PM_model$new("model.txt") 
#assumes model.txt is in working directory
#check with list.files() and/or getwd()
```

Saved models are only text files. You can write files directly yourself, although it is easier and more stable to use the model building app. We will review the format of the files in detail. In either R6 or Legacy Pmetrics, models are ultimately translated into Fortran text files with a header version of TSMULT\... 

**Naming your model files.** The default model file name is "model.txt,"
but you can call them whatever you wish. However, **please keep the
number of characters in the model file name ≤ 8**. When you use a model
file in a `$run()` method, at
the end of the run, your original model file will be left where it is,
but a copy called "genmodel.txt" will be in the /inputs
subfolder of the run folder, and a "genmodel.for" Fortran model file will
be in the /etc subfolder of the run folder.

**Structure of model files.** The model file is a text file with up to 10
blocks, each marked by \"\#\" followed by a header tag. 
For each header, only the capital letters are required for recognition
by Pmetrics. The blocks can be in any order, and header names are
case-insensitive (i.e. the capitalization here is just to show which
letters are required). Fortran is also case-insensitive, so in variable
names and expressions case is ignored. We include a
[complete example](#completeEx).

Important: Sometimes it is important to preserve spacing and formatting in 
Fortran code that you might insert into blocks, particularly the \#EXTRA block. 
If you wish to do this, insert [format] and [\/format] before and after any code 
that you wish to reproduce verbatim with spacing in the fortran model file.

Comments: You can insert comments into your model text file by starting a line 
with a capital "C" followed by a space. These lines will be removed/ignored 
in the final Fortran code.

## Model Sections

The model building app has a unique [Model library](#mb-lib) section not found in 
model files or lists. 

Sections common to all the model building pathways include the following:

* [PRImary variables](#mb-pri)
* [COVariates](#mb-cov)
* [SECcondary variables](#mb-sec)
* [INItial conditions](#mb-ini)
* [Fa (bioavailability)](#mb-fa)
* [LAG time](#mb-lag)
* [EQuatioNs](#mb-eqn)
* [OUTputs](#mb-out)

Lastly, sections which are specific to model files:

* [ERRor](#err)
* [EXTra](#extra)

### Model Library {#mb-lib}

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/front.png")
```

Here you can choose from pre-existing models, either which you have
created yourself and load with the Previous Model dialogue, or from the
Pmetrics Model Library. Use the filters and description search to help
select the model you want. Matching models will update in the box at the
bottom. If you select one, you'll see a model snapshot on the right.

In the snapshots, B is for bolus inputs, R is for Rate infusions (e.g.
intravenous infusions), and Y is for observations. Arrows indicate the
flow of drug. The grey compartment 0 is the environment.

Once you choose a model, hit the "Select" button at the bottom to
populate remaining model components. Similarly, if you load a Previous
Model, model components will be appropriately populated.

### PRImary {#mb-pri}

#### App

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/primary.png")
```

In this tab, you can choose the number and names of the primary
parameters. Variable names should be 11 characters or fewer. 
Some variable names are [reserved](#reserved) for use by Pmetrics and cannot be used as
primary variable names. **The number of primary variables must be
between 2 and 32, with at most 30 random or 20 fixed.**

These are the parameters for which value probability
distributions will be estimated. You can specify initial values as
ranges or mean/SD. The mean is the mid point of a range and the SD is
1/6 of the range, i.e. 3 SD above and below the mean. If you omit the
second value for a parameter (Max or SD), the parameter will become
"fixed", i.e. unknown value but zero variance in the population. In
other words Pmetrics will estimate the value but make it the same for
the whole population. The value you provide will be the starting
estimate. If you check the constant option, it will fix the parameter to
your value for every subject and not estimate. The GTZ option keeps the
parameter positive, which is only relevant for parametric analysis,
since nonparametric will respect parameter ranges strictly.

In the bottom you see the Model Diagram and the Model List. These
dynamically build as you complete the Model Components.

#### List

Primary variables are a list named "pri", comprising named elements which
are the parameters, and the function to define the parameter, one parameter to a line.

The two defining function are `ab` and `msd`. Choose one for each parameter.
The first defines the absolute search space for that parameter for NPAG/NPOD, 
i.e., the range. For IT2B/RPEM, it defines the mean of the prior as the midpoint 
of the range, and the range covers 6 standard deviations, e.g. ±3 SD above and 
below the mean, or 99.7% of the prior distribution. `msd` is the companion 
function that specifies a mean and SD in IT2B and RPEM. 
For NPAG/NPOD, it will be converted in to a range in the reverse fashion as 
described for `ab`. For both specifying functions, `gtz` is an argument to 
force the parameter value to be positive, i.e. `gtz=T`, which is the default. 
To allow negative parameters, set `gtz=F`.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ke = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 20),
      eff = ab(-2, 2, gtz = F)
    )
  )
)
```

#### File

Primary variables are a list of variable names, one name to a line.
On each line, following the variable name, is the range for the
parameter that defines the search space. These ranges behave slightly
differently for NPAG, IT2B, and the simulator.

- For all engines, the format of the limits is *min, max*. A single
    value will indicate that the parameter is to be fixed but unknown in
    the population, i.e. the value is taken as the starting point for
    the optimization, but the final value will depend on the model and
    data and will be the same across the population. A single value
    followed by an "!" will indicate that this value is to be held
    constant (i.e. fixed and known) across the population, and not to be
    estimated.

- For **NPAG**, when *min, max* limits are specified, they are
    absolute, i.e. the algorithm will not search outside this range.

- For **IT2B**, the range defines the Bayesian prior distribution of
    the parameter values for cycle 1. For each parameter, the mean of
    the Bayesian prior distribution is taken as the middle of the range,
    and the standard deviation is *xsig*\*range (see [[IT2B
    runs]{.underline}](\l)). Adding a plus sign (+) to a line will
    prevent that parameter from being assigned negative values. NPAG and
    the simulator will ignore the pluses as the ranges are absolute for
    these engines. Note that prior to version 1.5.0, this used to be an
    exclamation point (!) but to be consistent throughout the model
    file, the exclamation point is now used when fixed values are
    desired.

- The **simulator** will ignore the ranges with the default value of
    NULL for the *limits* argument. If the simulator *limits* argument
    is set to NA, which will mean that these ranges will be used as the
    limits to truncate the simulation (see [[Simulator
    Runs]{.underline}](\l)).

Example:
<div class="script">
\#Pri\
KE, +0, 5\
V, 0.01, 100\
KA, 0, 5\
KCP, 5\
KPC, 0 , 5\
Tlag1, 0, 2\
IC3, 0, 10000\
FA1, 0.5!
</div>


### COVariates {#mb-cov}

Covariates are subject-specific data, such as body weight, contained in
the data .csv file. The covariate names, which are the column names in
the data file, must be declared, even if not used in the model object. 
Once declared, they can be used in secondary variable
and differential equations. The order and names should be the same as in the data file.

Covariates are applied at each dose event. The first dose event for each
subject must have a value for every covariate in the data file. 
To change a covariate value at a time other than a dose, enter a dose event
with dose amount of zero.

By default, missing covariate values for subsequent dose events are
linearly interpolated between existing values, or carried forward if the
first value is the only non-missing entry. However, you can suppress interpolation and
carry forward the previous value in a piece-wise constant fashion, depending
on the way you define the model as described below.

#### App

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/covariates.png")
```

If you launch the Model Builder with a `PM_data` object as an argument,
the covariate tab will be pre-populated with the covariates in the data
file, as above. The same is true if you include a `PM_model` object
as an argument to `build_model()`. If you include both, the covariates
in the `PM_data` object will take precedence.
You can select any of them to make them piece-wise
constant, i.e. the value is held constant between measurements. If left
unchecked, covariate values will be linearly interpolated between
measurements.

#### List

Covariates are a list of objects returned by the `covariate()` function. The first
argument for the function is the quoted name of the covariate, and the second argument
is `constant`, which is `FALSE` by by default. This means that missing covariate values 
for subsequent dose events are linearly interpolated between existing values, or carried forward if the first value is the only non-missing entry. Set this argument to `TRUE` to make a covariate piece-wise constant.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(...),
    cov = list(
      covariate("wt"),
      covariate("age", constant = TRUE)
    )
  )
)
```

#### File

List the covariates by name, one per line in the \#COV block.
To make a covariate piece-wise constant, include an exclamation point (!) 
in the declaration line.

**Note** that any covariate relationship to any parameter may be
described as the user wishes by mathematical equations and Fortran code,
allowing for exploration of complex, non-linear, time-dependent, and/or
conditional relationships. This is accomplished in the [\#Sec](#mb-sec) block.

Example:

<div class="script">
\#Cov\
wt\
cyp\
IC!
</div>

where IC will be piece-wise constant and the other two will be linearly
interpolated for missing values.


### Secondary {#mb-sec}

Secondary variables are those that are defined by equations that are
combinations of primary, covariates, and other secondary variables. 
Pmetrics does NOT generate distributions for the values of secondary variables.
They are only used internally to define the model.

#### App

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/secondary.png")
```

If using secondary variables, define them first within this tab. 
Equation syntax for Secondary equations must be Fortran. It is
permissible to have conditional statements, but because expressions in
this block are translated into variable declarations, expressions other
than of the form "X = function(Y)" must be on a new line, prefixed by
"&" and contain only variables which have been previously defined in the
Primary, Covariate, or Secondary blocks.

The image shows examples of secondary variable declarations without
conditions. Here are two examples of conditional secondary variables
chosen on the basis of sex. The primary variables are Vm, Vf, CLm, and
CLf.

```         
V = Vm
&IF(sex == 1) V = Vf

V = Vm
CL = CLm
&IF(sex == 1) THEN
V = Vf
CL = CLF
ENDIF
```

#### List

Specify each variable equation as a list of unnamed character elements in the same way as for the app.
In the example below, V0 is the primary parameter which will be estimated, but internally, 
the model uses V as V0*wt, unless age is >18, in which case weight is capped at 75 kg. 
It's the same for CL0. Note that the conditional statement is not named.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      CL0 = ab(0, 5),
      V0 = msd(10, 3),
      eff = ab(-2, 2, gtz = F)
    ),
    cov = list(
      covariate("wt"),
      covariate("age")
    ),
    sec = list(
      "V = V0*wt",
      "&IF(age >18) V = V0 * 75",
      "CL = CL0 * wt"
    )
  )
)
```

#### File

Format is the same as for the app.

Example:

<div class="script">
\#Sec\
CL = Ke \* V \* wt\*\*0.75\
& IF(cyp .GT. 1) CL = CL \* cyp
</div>

### INItial conditions {#mb-ini}

By default, all model compartments have zero amounts at time 0. 
However, you can change the default initial condition of any
compartment from 0 to something else. It can be an equation, primary or
secondary variable, or covariate. 

#### App

We'll discuss more about the interface
in the section on [lag times](#mb-lag).

#### List

Initial conditions can be changed as a list called "ini", comprised of unnamed character elements. Each
line of the vector specifies the compartment amount as 
"X[.] = expression", where "." is the compartment number. 
Primary and secondary variables and covariates may be used in the expression, 
as can conditional statements in Fortran code. An "&" continuation prefix is 
not necessary in this block for any statement, although if present, will be ignored.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ke = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 30),
      IC3 = ab(0, 1000)
    ),
    cov = list(
      covariate("wt"),
      covariate("age"),
      covariate("IC2")
    ),
    ini = list(
      "X[1] = IC2*V",
      "X[3] = IC3"
    )
  )
)
```

In the example above, IC is a covariate with the measured trough
concentration prior to an observed dose and IC3 is a fitted primary parameter specifying an initial amount in unobserved compartment 3.

In the first case, the initial condition for compartment 2 becomes the
value of the IC covariate (defined in `cov` list) multiplied by
the current estimate of V during each iteration. This is useful when a
subject has been taking a drug as an outpatient, and comes in to the lab for PK sampling, with measurement of a concentration immediately prior to a witnessed dose, which is in turn followed by more sampling. In this case, IC or any other covariate can be set to the initial measured concentration, and if V is the volume of compartment 2, the  initial condition (amount) in compartment 2 will now be set to the measured concentration of drug multiplied by the estimated volume for each iteration until convergence.

In the second case, the initial condition for compartment 3 becomes
another variable, IC3 defined in the `pri` list, to fit in the
model, given the observed data.

#### File

The same example as for the list above is shown
below in the format for the file.

<div class="script">
\#Ini\
X(2) = IC\*V\
X(3) = IC3\
</div>


### FA (bioavailability) {#mb-fa}

In this tab you can change the default bioavailability of any bolus
input from 1 to something else. It can be an equation, primary or
secondary variable, or covariate. 

#### App

We'll discuss more about the interface
in the section on [lag times](#mb-lag).

#### List

Bioavailability for any bolus input can be changed from the default value of 1.
Use  a list called "fa", comprised of unnamed character elements, where each line is of the form "FA[.] =
expression", and "." is the input number. Primary and secondary
variables and covariates may be used in the expression, as can
conditional statements in Fortran code. An "&" continuation prefix is 
not necessary in this block for any statement, although if present, will be ignored.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ke = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 30),
      FA1 = ab(0, 1)
    ),
    fa = list(
      "FA[1] = FA1"
    )
  )
)
```

#### File

The same example as for the list above is shown
below in the format for the file.

<div class="script">
\#Fa\
FA(1) = FA1
</div>

### LAG time {#mb-lag}

The lag time is a delay in absorption for a bolus input.

#### App

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/lag.png")
```

You can change the default delay in absorption of any bolus
input from 0 to something else. It can be an equation, primary or
secondary variable, or covariate. If you wish to use any of the latter
three, select them from the drop down and the equation will
pre-populate, as shown in the image. You can edit the equation or write
your own equation. This is true for initial conditions and
bioavailability in their tabs.

#### List

Use a list called "lag", comprised of unnamed character elements, each of the form 
"LAG[.] = expression", where "." is the input number. Primary and secondary 
variables and covariates may be used in the expression, as can conditional statements 
in Fortran code. An "&" continuation prefix is not necessary in this block 
for any statement, although if present, will be ignored.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ke = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 30),
      lag1 = ab(0, 4)
    ),
    lag = list(
      "LAG[1] = lag1"
    )
  )
)
```

#### File

The same example as for the list above is shown
below in the format for the file.

<div class="script">
\#Lag\
TLAG(1) = Tlag1
</div>

### EQuatioNs {#mb-eqn}

These are the equations that define the structural model, i.e., the
mathematical expressions that relate input (dose) to output (measurements).
Pmetrics has a library of models with algebraic solutions and models can also
use differential equations in a format compatible with R. Even algebraic models 
will contain differential equations for purposes of understanding and plotting the model, but
algebraic models from the library include a token which tells Pmetrics how to
choose the correct model. Details below.

#### App

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/eqn.png")
```

If you have not loaded a prior model file or selected a model from the library,
you can write the differential equations here. **There can
be a maximum of 20 such equations.** The model diagram 
will update as information in the equations becomes available. 

Use `dX[i]` for change in compartment amounts, where i is the compartment number, 
e.g. dX[1] or dX[2]. Compartment amounts are referred to as `X[i]`, e.g. X[1] or X[2].
Use `BOLUS[j]` for bolus input j and `RATEIV[k]` for infusion k. 
The indeces j and k correspond to the INPUT column in the data file, 
which is usually omitted and assumed to be 1 for all doses.
These can be abbreviated as "BOL[j]" or "B[j]", for a bolus or "R[k]" for an infusion.
The duration of the infusion and total dose is defined in the data.csv file. **Up to 7 inputs are currently
allowed.** The *DUR* column in the data file determines whether a dose is treated 
as a BOLUS (DUR = 0) or RATEIV (DUR > 0). 
Any variable defined in PRI, COV, or SEC may be used in your equations.

If you build an algebraic model in the app by choosing it from the model library and save the file, 
it will contain an #EQN block, with a token to indicate that the model will
be solved algebraically. The differential equations in this case are included 
only for information purposes and to enable plotting of the model. The format of the
algebraic token is four comma-separated arrays, each surrounded by "[]" and named
"P" for parameters in alpha order, "B" for bolus input compartments, "R" for rate (IV) 
input compartments, and "O" for output compartments.
For example, "{algebraic: P[Ka,Ke,V], B[1], R[2], O[2]}" or "{algebraic: P[Ke,KCP,KPC,V], B[0], R[1], O[1]}".
<span class="update">Update</span>Eventually the tokens will also recognize model names familiar to many pharmacometricians such as {algebraic: ADVAN1 TRANS1} for {algebraic: P[Ke,V], B[0], R[1], O[1]}.

**Note:** If you change the equations of an algebraic model loaded from the library,
you will receive a warning in the app that you are forcing use of ODE solvers, and your model list
(and file) will no longer have the algebraic token. Beware also of changing the parameter
names, as the algebraic models must use specifically named parameters. However, it 
is perfectly acceptable to add parameters,or even change primary parameters 
as long as the original appear in the secondary block. 
For example, if you wish to make volume dependent on weight, change `V` in the Primary section to something like `V0` with appropriate range or mean/SD, and add `V = V0 * wt` to your Secondary section, assuming you have a covariate named "wt". Because `V` is still defined, Pmetrics will know how to solve the algebraic model.

#### List

Specify a model as a list called "eqn", comprised of unnamed character elements, with each element an 
ordinary differential equation in the same R format
as for the app. Additional equations can be included.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ka = ab(0, 5),
      Ke = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 30),
      Kcp = ab(0, 5),
      Kpc = ab(0, 5)
    ),
    eqn = list(
      "ktotal = Ke + Kcp",
      "dX[1] = BOLUS[1] -Ka * X[1]",
      "dX[2] = RATEIV[1] + Ka * X[1] - (ktotal) * X[2] + Kpc * X[3]",
      "dX[3] = Kcp * X[2] - Kpc * X[3]"
    )
  )
)
```

#### File

This block was formerly called "\#DIF", and Pmetrics will recognize this header,
but we encourage you to adopt the more general \#EQN block name.

Example:

<div class="script">
\#EQN\
ktotal = Ke + KCP\
dX[1] = BOLUS[1] -KA\*X[1]\
dX[2] = RATEIV[1] + KA\*X[1] - (ktotal)\*X[2] + KPC\*X[3]\
dX[3] = KCP\*X[2] - KPC\*X[3]
</div>

Pmetrics will still recognize the old Fortran format of XP(1), which is dX[1], and
X(1), which is X[1], but please transition to the new format to be
more compatible with R and eventual transition away from Fortran.

### Outputs {#mb-out}

The outputs in Pmetrics are the values in the *OUT* column of the data that you are trying to predict. In the model objects, each output
is referred to as `Y[.]`, where "." is the number of the output and the
same as the corresponding *OUTEQ* in the data. Outputs can be defined
as mathematical combinations of compartment amounts (`X[.]`), primary and/or
secondary parameters, or covariates.

Output equations are in R format. However, if they include conditional statements, these should follow Fortran conventions, e.g. with `IF()` and `ENDIF` rather than R's `if(){}` convention. An "&" continuation prefix is not necessary in this block for any statement, although if present, will be ignored. **There can be a maximum of 6 outputs.** 

Because outputs are measurements, they have an associated error in that
measurement. Pmetrics takes this into account by partitioning model residual
prediction error into a fixed portion defined by the assay error, which may
be inflated by an additive model error component $\lambda$ or a proportional component $\gamma$, which reflect additional noise and model misspecification. The remaining error is random.

In the app and list, the error is defined with each output. In the file, the
error block is distinct from but correlates with the output block.

#### App

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/output.png")
```

On this tab, you can choose the number of output equations and define the equation for each output. You do not need to specify "Y[.] =" in the equations. Simply include the right side of the equation in the field. 

Include the **Assay Error** polynomial coefficients for each output equation. 
The four coefficients estimate SD according to the folowing equation: $C0 + C1 * [obs] + C2 * [obs]^2 + C3 * [obs]^3$ and $[obs]$ is the observation. The values for the coefficients should ideally come from the analytic lab in the form of inter-run standard deviations or coefficients of variation at standard concentrations. You can use the Pmetrics function `makeErrorPoly()` to choose the best set of coefficients that fit the data from the
laboratory. Alternatively, you can use a generic set of coefficients. We
recommend that as a start, $C0$ be set to half of the lowest
concentration in the dataset and $C1$ be set to 0.1. $C2$ and $C3$ can
be 0.

If you check the *Use Always?* box, the model coefficients will be used
regardless of what is in the data file. Leaving it unchecked, which is
the default, means that coefficients in the data file will be used if
present, and the ones here in the model definition will be used only if none are available for an observation in the data.

Choose your **Model Error** model from the drop down. The additive $\lambda$ and proportional $\gamma$ models both have fixed options. If not fixed, the parameter will be estimated, starting from the number in the *Value* field. If fixed, it will be held constant at the number in the *Value* field.

The proportional model weights each observation by $1/(\gamma * SD)^2$, where $\gamma$ is either fixed or estimated. The additive model weights each observation by $1/(\lambda + SD)^2$, where $\lambda$ is either fixed or estimated. The combination model uses $1/((\gamma * SD)^2 + (\lambda + SD)^2)$.

In the proportional model, $\gamma$ is a scalar on assay SD. In general,
well-designed and executed studies and models with low mis-specification will have data with $\gamma$ values approaching 1. Values <1 suggest over-inflated assay noise. Poor quality, noisy data will result in $\gamma$ of 5 or more. A good starting value for $\gamma$ is usually 5, and sometimes 10 early in model
development if data are particularly complex or noisy.

In the additive model, $\lambda$ is additive to assay SD. In general,
well-designed and executed studies and models with low mis-specification will have data with $\lambda$ values approaching 0. Values of 0 may suggest over inflated assay noise. Poor quality, noisy data will result in $\lambda$ of $5*C0$ or more. A good starting value for $\lambda$ is usually $3*C0$. Note, that $C0$
should generally not be 0, as it represents machine noise (e.g. HPLC or
mass spectrometer) that is always present.

#### List

The `out` list is a series of nested lists.  The outermost list groups all the outputs, which are themselves lists named as `Y1`, `Y2`, etc. Each of these output lists contains the value of the equation and the error model. Within the error model for that output, is the last list comprising model and assay error specifications. In the examples below, we build this nested list structure gradually to make it more clear.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
out = list(
  Y1 = list(...)
)
```

The output equation is a character vector named "val" followed by an error list. 

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
out = list(
  Y1 = list(
    val = "X[1]/V",
    err = list(...)
  )
)
```

The error model for an output equation has two elements. The first is the `model` error, which can be one of two functions: `proportional` for $\gamma$ or `additive` for $\lambda$. The arguments to these functions are a number and optionally `fixed`, which defaults to `FALSE`. If `fixed` is `FALSE`, the number serves as the starting estimate for the model error. If `fixed` is `TRUE`, the number serves as the model error, with no estimation. Note that you can only fix the additive model currently to zero.

The second element is the `assay` error model. It is a function `errorPoly(coeffs, constant = FALSE)`. 
The first argument `coeff` is the vector of 4 numbers that defines a polynomial equation to permit calculation of the standard deviation of an observation, based on the noise of the assay. The second argument `constant` 
is `FALSE` by default, which means that coefficients in the data file will be used if
present, and the ones here in the model definition will be used only if none are available
for an observation in the data. If `constant = TRUE`, the model coefficients will be used
regardless of what is in the data file.


```{r echo=T, eval=F}
out = list(
  Y1 = list(
    val = "X(1)/V",
    err = list(
      model = proportional(1),
      assay = errorPoly(c(0.15, 0.1, 0, 0))
    )
  )
)
```


```{r echo=T, eval=F}
out = list(
  Y1 = list(
    val = "X(1)/V",
    err = list(
      model = additive(1, fixed = TRUE)
      assay = errorPoly(c(0.05, 0.1, 0, 0), constant = TRUE)
    )
  )
)
```

More complete examples.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
mod <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ke = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 30),
    ),
    out = list(
      y1 = list(
        val = "X(1)/V",
        err = list(
          model = proportional(5),
          assay = errorPoly(c(0.05, 0.1, 0, 0))
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

mod2 <- PM_model$new(
  list(
    pri = list(
      kin = ab(0, 5),
      kout = ab(0, 5),
      tpd = ab(0, 5),
      V = msd(100, 30),
    ),
    sec = c(
      "RES = B(1) * KIN/(KIN-KOUT) * (EXP(-KOUT*TPD)-EXP(-KIN*TPD))"
    ),
    out = list(
      y1 = list(
        val = "RES/V",
        err = list(
          model = combination(0.4, 3) #additive, proportional
          assay = errorPoly(c(0.3, 0.15, 0, 0))
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

This last example is known as the Bateman equation for a model with
linear absorption (KIN) into and elimination (KOUT) from a central
compartment, and a time post-dose (TPD) or lag time. Here B(1) is the
oral bolus dosing vector for drug 1, and V is the volume of the central
compartment.

#### File

Outputs are of the form Y[.] =
expression, where \".\" is the output equation number. Primary and
secondary variables and covariates may be used in the expression, as can
conditional statements in Fortran code. An \"&\" continuation prefix is
not necessary in this block for any statement, although if present, will
be ignored. **There can be a maximum of 6 outputs.** They are referred
to as Y[1], Y[2], etc. These equations may also define a model
explicitly as a function of primary and secondary variables and
covariates.

As mentioned previously, in the file method of model definition, assay
and model error are defined in a separate [\#Err](#err) block.

Examples:

<div class="script">
\#Out\
Y[1] = X[2]/V
</div>

Again, Pmetrics will recognize the older format Y(1), which is Y[1], but
users are encouraged to adopt the newer format.

Here's an example of an explicit model defined in the output and not the 
equation block. 

<div class="script">
\#OUT\

RES = BOLUS[1] \* KIN/(KIN-KOUT) \* (EXP(-KOUT\*TPD)-EXP(-KIN\*TPD))\
Y[1] = RES/VD
</div>


### Error {#err}

#### App, List

The error section in the app and list forms of model definitions is included with
the outputs.

#### File

Unlike the R6 model builder app or model list, the error block in the file is 
separated from the output block. This is to maintain backward compatibility 
with Legacy Pmetrics.

To specify the model in this block, the first line is either
L=number or G=number for a $\lambda$ or $\gamma$ error model. The
number is the starting value for $\lambda$ or $\gamma$. 
If you include an exclamation point (!) in the declaration,
then $\lambda$ or $\gamma$ will be fixed and not estimated. Recall that you can only fix $\lambda$ currently to zero.

The next line(s) contain the values for the assay error polynomial coefficients: $C0$, $C1$, $C2$, and $C3$,
separated by commas. There should be one line of coefficients for each
output equation. By default Pmetrics will use values for these
coefficients found in the data file. If none are present or if the model
declaration line contains an exclamation point (!) the values here will
be used.

Example 1: estimated $\lambda$, starting at 0.4, one output, use data file
coefficients but if missing, use 0.1,0.1,0,0.

<div class="script">
\#Err\
L=0.4\
0.1,0.1,0,0\
</div>

Example 2: fixed $\gamma$ of 2, two outputs, use data file coefficients but
if missing, use 0.1,0.1,0,0 for the first output, but use 0.3, 0.1, 0, 0
for output 2 regardless of what is in the data file.

<div class="script">
\#Err\
G=2!\
0.1,0.1,0,0\
0.3,0.1,0,0!\
</div>

### Extra

#### App, List

This block is not currently implemented in either the app or list forms.

#### File

This block is for advanced Fortran programmers only. 
<span class="update>Update</span>.
Occasionally, for very complex models, additional Fortran subroutines are required. They can be placed here. The code must specify complete Fortran subroutines
which can be called from other blocks with appropriate call functions.
As stated earlier, sometimes it is important to preserve spacing and
formatting in Fortran code that you might insert into blocks,
particularly the \#EXTRA block. If you wish to do this, insert [format] and [\/format] in the fortran model file around the affected code.


### Complete File Example {#completeEx}

Here is a complete example of a model file, as of Pmetrics version 2.1
and higher:

<div class="script">
\#Pri\
KE, 0, 5\
V0, 0.1, 100\
KA, 0, 5\
Tlag1, 0, 3\

\#Cov\
wt\
C this weight is in kg\

\#Sec\
V = V0*wt\

\#Lag\
TLAG[1] = Tlag1\

\#Out\
Y[1] = X[2]/V\

\#Err\
L=0.4\
0.1,0.1,0,0\
</div>

*Notes*:

By omitting a \#EQN block with ODEs, Pmetrics understands that you
are specifying the model to be solved algebraically. In this case, at
least KE and V must be in the Primary or Secondary variables. KA, KCP,
and KPC are optional and specify absorption, and transfer to and from
the central to a peripheral compartment, respectively.

As described above, if you build the same algebraic model in the app and save the file, 
it will contain an #EQN block, with a token to indicate that the model will
be solved algebraically and differential equations only for information purposes
and to enable plotting of the model. 

The comment line "C this weight is in kg" will be ignored.

## Saving and copying models from the app

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/model_builder/output2.png")
```

The Model List tab in the bottom window of the app shows the 
List form of the model. You can see it develop as you complete
components. Once the model is finished, you can use one or both
of the buttons at the bottom to copy or save the model. 

Choosing *Copy* will put the code in you clipboard and you can paste
it into R. It will include `PM_model$new(...)`, so you should add
code such as `mod1 <- ` to your R script, and then paste. This will
entirely define `mod1` as a `PM_model` equivalent to what you built
in the app.

Choosing *Save* in the app will write a file named "model.txt" to your
current working directory in R that contains all the code necessary to define
the same model as you build in the app. Be aware that if there is another
file named "model.txt" in your working directory, it will be overwritten.

While incomplete models can be copied, a model can only be saved when it is
complete. It is necessary for you to at least open relevant components to ensure that all fields are finalized in the Model List before you can save it.

## Updating models {#update-model}

### App

You can update an existing model in one of two ways in the app:

* Pass the `PM_model` object to the app as an argument to `build_model()`,
for example, `build_model(NPex$model)`.  Then, edit the appropriate fields 
in the app. Save the model as a new model and/or copy
it into R. Note that the app saves all models as "model.txt" so be sure not to
overwrite your old model if you wish to keep it. 
* Load a previously saved model file using the dialog button in the app and
proceed as for the first option above.

### List

Because models are loaded as memory items in R6 Pmetrics, they can be modified 
in R without having to edit text files. This function is accessed via the 
`$update()` method for `PM_model` objects.

All R6 objects are mini-environments, so direct copies of an R6 environment are in the same environment and changes to one will change them all. This means the following code will likely not work as intended.

```{r echo=T, eval = F}
mod2 <- mod1
mod2$update(...)
```

When *mod2* is updated, *mod1* will update as they are in the same environment. The way to create an independent copy of an R6 object, which does not share the same environment, is to use the `$clone()` method available for all R6 objects.

```{r echo=T, eval = F}
mod2 <- mod1$clone()
mod2$update(...)
```

Now changes to mod2 do not propagate to mod1.

To update a model, simply supply the list items you wish to change with the new values. 

```{r echo=T, eval = F}

mod2$update(
  list(
    pri = list(
      Ke = ab(1, 3),
      V = NULL,
      V0 = ab(0, 20)
    ),
    sec = "V = V0 * wt"
  )
)
```

This example changes the range of *Ke*, deletes *V*, adds *V0*, and defines a 
new secondary relationship for *V = V0 \* wt*. 

### File


The only way to update a model file is to edit the text file and load it with 
`PM_model$new()`. The advantage is that it is quick and relatively easy. 
The disadvantage is that you have to keep editing, copying and pasting files, 
and unless your documentation in R or elsewhere is good, you have no idea how 
you changed the model from run to run. In contrast, by using the `$update()` 
method in R6, you can see a written record of how the model 
evolved over the project.


## Reserved Names {#reserved}

The following cannot be used as primary, covariate, or secondary
variable names. They can be used in equations, however.

```{r echo=F}
res <- read.csv("Data/reserved.csv")
knitr::kable(res, col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(res)))
```
