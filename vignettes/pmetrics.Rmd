## What is Pmetrics?
Pmetrics is a population modeling and simulation package for R. It can model data using nonparametric and parametric approaches. Some excellent articles discussing the differences, strengths, and limitations of both approaches are below.

## How do I get Pmetrics?

It's easy and *all free*!

1. Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org)
2. Install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com), from [posit](https://posit.co).
3. Install the *devtools* package into Rstudio. The easiest way is to click the Install button on the Packages tab, and search the CRAN repository for *devtools*.

4. Type the following into the R console (lower left window):
`devtools::install_github("LAPKB/Pmetrics")`
5. Launch Pmetrics in Rstudio with `library(Pmetrics)`
6. Run `PMbuild()` to download necessary components and install them. It might be many components, depending on your system.

That's it! 

## How do I get help?

Head on over to our [Discussion](https://github.com/LAPKB/Pmetrics/discussions) board at Github.

## How do I start using Pmetrics?

A good place to start is to run `PM_tutorial()`, which will install an **Examples** folder at your chosen location, which will contain sample data, models, and a script to get you started building and simulating from population models. Also have a look at the Articles on this website. All functions are extensively documented, most with examples, which can be seen in the Reference section of the [website](https://lapkb.github.io/Pmetrics/). There are also more tutorials and references on our Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and Bioinformatics [website](http://www.lapk.org).
