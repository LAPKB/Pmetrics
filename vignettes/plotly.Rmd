# Background

As of version 2, *Pmetrics* uses the *plotly* package for most plots. Plots
made with plotly are interactive, so that moving your cursor over them
results in pop up information being displayed. Plotly is a successor to the
very popular *ggplot2* package.

However, the documentation for plotly is a bit complex and often lacking in 
sufficient examples. This vignette attempts to orient you to the specific
aspects of plotly most relevant to Pmetric.

# General

Plotly is based on a foundation of lists. Most plot elements are lists whose
arguments control characteristics of the elements. Pmetrics chiefly uses only
a handful of the elements.

Full descriptions of plotly elements and options to control them can be accessed
by typing `plotly::schema()` into the R console. If you have already loaded 
plotly you can just type `schema()`. You will see something like the menu below
in the Viewer tab in Rstudio.

In plotly, the layout items control everything to do with the appearance of the
axes and the legend. The traces items control appearance of the data.  

# Traces 

Pmetrics almost exclusively uses scatter traces, and those elements can be 
referenced by expanding traces `r knitr::asis_output("\U25B6")` scatter 
`r knitr::asis_output("\U25B6")` attributes.

There are many such attributes, but the most commonly used and accessible to the
user are line and marker.

## Line attributes

All plotly plots in Pmetrics have a `line` argument which maps to the *line* attribute 
of a plotly scatter trace. 
When Pmetrics detects a boolean argument, e.g. `TRUE` or `FALSE` it either plots
the default line or suppresses the line altogether. A good example of this is the
`line` argument to `plot.PM_op` to generate an observed vs. predicted plot. In this
function.

```{r, echo = T, eval = T}
NPex$op$plot(line = list(lm = T, loess = F, ref = T))
```
