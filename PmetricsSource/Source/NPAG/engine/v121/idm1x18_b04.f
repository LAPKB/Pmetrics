c  idm1x18.f                                               3/11/15

c  idm1x18 has the following change from idm1x17:

c  All numbers written out in F or G format are now tested to see if
c  they are inside [-1.D-99, 1.D-99]. If so, they are changed to be
c  0. The reason is that otherwise they will be printed out without 
c  the accompanying D or E (e.g., as .934-106, rather than .934E-106).

c  Note that this module is linked with npageng30.f initially.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x17.f                                               12/05/14

c  idm1x17 has the following changes from idm1x16:

c  It has the Threadprivate and Save statements to make it compatible
c  with the new npageng28.f program. These statements allow the 
c  program to be run in parallel. There are some other changes also
c  (see !).

c  In the call to SHIFT in Subroutine FUNC, the arguments ND,SIG,RS,
c  are changed to NDO,SIGO,RSO. This means that ND,SIG,RS, don't have
c  to be reset back to their original values at the end of FUNC. 
c  Similarly, BSO is used instead of BS.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x16.f                                               7/21/14

c  idm1x16 has the following changes from idm1x15:

c  1. In subroutine USERANAL, the dimensions of RWORK and IWORK are
c  now made consistent with the maximum allowable no. of compartments
c  (i.e., differential equations). In Subroutine DVODE, comments
c  indicate that RWORK must be dimensioned (for MF = 21 OR 22, which
c  is the case in our programs) at least 22 +  9*NEQ + 2*NEQ**2,
c  where NEQ = the no. of differential eqs.). Since NEQ = NDIM can be 
c  as high as 20, RWORK is now dimensioned 1002. And correspondingly,
c  LRW must be also set = 1002.

c  Similarly, the dimension of IWORK, and the value of LIW must be
c  30 + NEQ = 50.

c  2. If the program stops unexpectedly with the writing of format 111
c  in Subroutine FUNC, this same comment will now be written to
c  the file, ERRFIL, which is passed to FUNC in COMMON/ERR.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x15.f                                               3/6/14

c  idm1x15 has the following changes from idm1x14:

c  1. In Subroutine FUNC, the dimensions related to the no. of output
c  equations have been changed from 6 to NUMEQT OR MAXNUMEQ (see 
c  comments in that routine).

c  2. In Subroutines FUNC and PREDLAST3, the dimensions of 6 in XSTORE,
c  XPRED, and COMP have been changed to 20, as they should have been 
c  all along (i.e., this represents the maximum no. of compartments
c  allowed).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x14.f                                               10/11/12

c  idm1x14 has one correction from idm1x13:

c  THE R(.) ARE SET = RS(.,.) BEFORE GETIX IS CALLED IN THE TIME RESET
c  SECTION OF SUBROUTINE FUNC. NOT DOING THIS WOULD MEAN THAT IF THE 
C  INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE X(.) ARE FUNCTIONS OF THE COVARIATES
C  (ESTABLISHED IN GETIX FROM THE R(.) VALUES), THEY WOULD BE ASSIGNED
C  VALUES BASED ON COVARIATES FROM A PREVIOUS DOSAGE LINE IN THE
C  PATIENT'S DATA FILE, RATHER THAN THE LINE WHICH IS THE DOSE RESET
C  LINE.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x13.f                                               9/27/12

c  idm1x13 has the following bug correction to idm1x12:

C  IN SUBROUTINE FUNC, BEFORE
C  THE FIRST CALL TO GETFA, THE R(.) ARE SET = RS(.,.) IN CASE ANY OF
C  THE FA(.) ARE FUNCTIONS OF THE COVARIATES WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED FROM
C  THE R(.) VALUES IN  GETFA. IN ADDITION, PRIOR TO THE 2 SECTIONS WHERE
C  THE FA(.) ARE USED, GETFA IS CALLED SO THAT THE FA(.) ARE UPDATED TO
C  CURRENT VALUES, BASED ON THE MOST RECENT COVARIATE VALUES IN THE
C  PATIENT'S DATA FILE. IN PREVIOUS PROGRAMS, IT WAS SIMPLY ASSUMED
C  THAT THE FA(.) WERE FUNCTIONS OF THE PARAMETERS, BUT NOT THE
C  COVARIATES, AND SO THIS WASN'T NECESSARY. BUT THE CODE IN 
C  TSTMULTI.FOR IMPLIES THAT THE FA(.) COULD BE FUNCTIONS OF THE
C  COVARIATES, AND SO THIS CHANGE IS NECESSARY.

C  NOTE THAT SETTING THE R(.) TO RS(.,.) BEFORE THE FIRST CALL TO
C  GETFA ALSO MEANS THE R(.) WILL BE SET BEFORE GETIX AND GETTLAG ARE
C  FIRST CALLED, WHICH AGAIN IS REQUIRED IN CASE THEY ESTABLISH VALUES
C  AS FUNCTIONS OF THE COVARIATES IN THE PATIENT DATA FILE.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x12.f                                               7/25/12

c  idm1x12 has the following change to idm1x11:

c  In SUBROUTINE FUNC, the code to save ND0, SIGO, RSO, is moved to
c  before the IF(N .EQ. 0) GO TO 75  statement. The reason is that 
c  before this  routine returns, ND, SIG, and RS are reset back to these
c  values, even if N = 0, and so they must be established at this time.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x11.f                                               5/25/12

c  idm1x11 has the following changes from idm1x10:

C  IT HAS CODE CHANGES IN SUBROUTINE PREDLAST3 TO HANDLE THE CASE WHERE
C  PRED1 + PRED3 - 2*PRED2 = 0 --> PREDNEG SHOULD NOT BE CALCULATED. 
C  USUALLY THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE MODEL/DOSAGE REGIMEN IS SO "EASY"
C  TO PREDICT THAT THE 3 PREDICTED VALUES ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER,
C  AND BY "BAD LUCK" COULD BE IN A LINEAR PROGRESSION. I.E., IF
C  PRED1 + DEL = PRED2, AND PRED2 + DEL = PRED3, THEN 
C  PRED1 + PRED3 - 2*PRED2 = 0.

C  IN THIS CASE, OF COURSE, PREDNEG SHOULD NOT BE CALCULATED SINCE THAT
C  WILL RESULT IN A DIVIDE BY 0, OR A NaN IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT STOP.

C  WHEN THIS HAPPENS (SEE CODE IN PREDLAST3), WHETHER OR NOT CONVERGENCE
C  IS ACHIEVED WILL DEPEND SOLELY ON THE TOL1 CRITERION (I.E., THE TOL2
C  CRITERION CANNOT BE USED, AND IS UNNEEDED).

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x10.f                                               4/14/12

c  idm1x10 has the following changes to idm1x9.f:

c  It is to be used with npageng17.f, which allows steady state doses
c  to be boluses as well as IVs. As a result, an additional parameter,
c  ISKIPBOL, is used so, in Subroutine FUNC, when convergence occurs in
c  a steady state dose set, the last bolus from that set will not be
c  reapplied below label 83.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x9.f                                               3/2/12

c  idm1x9 has the following bug fix to idm1x8.f. In Subroutine FUNC, the
c  code to save ND, SIG, and RS before altering them if there are 
c  time lag parameters (in the call to GETTLAG) is now executed whether
c  or not there are time lag parameters. The reason is that, with steady
c  state doses, the first SIG(.) time in a steady state dose set is
c  reset to be 0 after the steady state dose is identified. And this
c  time must be reset back to be its original negative value at the end
c  of the routine so that the next time the routine is called, the 
c  program will again know when a steady state dose is coming. 

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x8.f                                                1/15/12

c  Corrects bug in Subroutine FUNC - now time resets are identified
c  by just the observation time = 0 (i.e., the dose time = 0 is
c  no longer required). This is because it is possible for a dose
c  time (especially if there are timelags) to be after the last
c  observation time in a section of the patient file (before a time
c  reset), and if this happens, the program will not be able to
c  identify the observation time of 0 as a time reset.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x7.f                                                11/21/11

c  idm1x7 has the following changes from idm1x6:

c  1. It can accommodate steady state dose regimens as created by 
c  new subroutine NEWWORK1.FOR in npageng16.f. And it has new
c  Subroutine PREDLAST3 (both of these 2 new subroutines are based on
c  stand-a-lone versions of the same name) which is called by
c  Subroutine FUNC to predict the final (steady state) compartment
c  amounts. If these predicted values are determined to have
c  converged, the rest of the steady state dose set will be skipped
c  to save time. Note that predictions start after the end of the
c  5th dose set (out of 100 in each steady state regimen), and
c  continue until convergence is reached, or the entire steady state
c  dose set has been integrated through.

C  SO THE MAIN CHANGES TO THE CODE ARE:

C  CHECK TO SEE IF A DOSE TIME IS NEGATIVE. IF NOT, PROCEED AS USUAL. IF 
C  SO, PROCEED AS IF THAT TIME WAS 0, BUT AFTER THE END OF THAT DOSE AND 


C  THE NEXT 4, CALL SUBROUTINE PREDLAST3 TO PREDICT THE STEADY STATE
C  COMPARTMENT AMOUNTS AFTER THE 100 DOSES (NOTE THAT THE COMPARTMENT
C  AMOUNTS WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND AT THE END OF EACH OF THE STEADY STATE
C  DOSES OF COURSE AS THE LOGIC OF PREDLAST3 REQUIRES). IF CONVERGENCE
C  IS ACHIEVED, ASSIGN THE COMPARTMENT AMOUNTS TO BE THE PREDICTED
C  AMOUNTS AND SET KNS TO BE WHAT IT IS WHEN THESE STEADY STATE DOSE 
C  SETS HAVE FINISHED. ALSO, SET T = END OF THE STEADY STATE DOSE SET
C  SINCE THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD ALL THE DOSES BEEN 
C  INTEGRATED THROUGH.

c  2. All arrays related to doses (SIG,SIGO,RS,RSO, and BS) in
c  Subroutine FUNC have their 500's changed to 5000's. This is because
c  each set of 100 steady state doses, with each of up to 7 drugs having
c  its own stopping time, could require an extra 100 x 8 dose events, 

c  and there could be multiple steady state sets (they can occur at the
c  start of the dose regimen, or at any time reset point).

c  3. Near the top of Subroutine FUNC, R(1)=0.0D0 is replaced by setting
c  R(2*I-1) = 0.D0, for I = 1,NDRUG. This should have been done when
c  the program became a multi-drug program (see comment in FUNC).

c  4. A time reset no longer requires all initial compartment amounts
c  to be reset to 0. This is because a time reset no longer has to mean
c  an "infinite" amount of time has occurred with no dosing; it can also
c  now mean an "infinite" amount of time has occurred with unknown 
c  dosing. So Subroutine GETIX will be called to establish initial
c  conditions for the new time period (these initial values can of
c  course be 0's as was always assumed in previous programs). This is
c  the situation where a patient, who previously had doses and
c  observations which were recorded while he was in a lab, goes home and
c  gets unknown doses over a long time period, and then returns to the
c  lab to get a new set of doses and observations, starting with 
c  observations which establish his initial conditions for this new
c  time period.


c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x6.f                                                12/20/10

c  idm1x6 has the following change to idm1x5:

c  In Subroutine FUNC, it has code that calls Subroutine ANAL3, rather
c  than USERANAL if N .EQ. -1. Also, the code to reset X(I),I=1,N to 0
c  where there is a time reset now includes extra code to set 
c  X(I),I=1,3 to 0 if N .EQ. -1.

c  Note that ANAL3, and the routines it calls are from the Little NPAG

c  program module, IDPC9A.FOR. 

c  Note that this module is linked first with bigmlt11.f, and the 
c  template model file is TSTMULTH.FOR (in which in Subroutine SYMBOL,
c  the user is told to code N=-1 if he wants to assume the standard
c  3-compartment linear model with analytic solutions, and in this 
c  case also establish the 5 parameters, {KE,KA,KCP,KPC,V} of this
c  model).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x5.f							4/03/10

c  idm1x5 has a bug correction to idm1x4. In Subroutine FUNC, in the
c  IF(TIM(KNT) .EQ. 0.D0 .AND. SIG(KNS) .EQ. 0.D0) block, the time,
c  T, is also reset = 0 since the integration will again start from
c  time 0. When this wasn't done (in idm1x4.f), the results were
c  unpredictable (depending on how the DVODE integration routines
c  treated a (T,TOUT) pair which decreased rather than increased.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x4.f							11/23/09

c  idm1x4 fixes a bug in the idm1x3 code. Label 75 is moved to in
c  front of the  CALL GETTLAG(TLAG)  statement (see the reason in
c  that part of the code).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x3.f							9/18/09

c  idm1x3 has the following changes from idm1x2:

c  1. The TLAG and FA vectors, and the initial values for the X array 
c  will be set by calling new routines (GETTLAG, GETFA, and GETIX, 
c  respectively) that are part of the model file (the new template is 
c  TSTMULT.FOR). This means the user can now code explicit formulas
c  for these values. As a result, all reference to NTLAG, IC, IFA, and
c  IVOL have been removed.

c  2. The shift subroutine will now be from the module, shift5.f, 
c  rather than shift4.f.

c  3. In Subroutine USERANAL, ISTATE is no longer written out. This
c  can slow the program a lot if the numerical integrator (DVODE) is
c  struggling with the integrations. Instead, the total no. of calls to
c  XERRWD (the routine which writes the details of the warnings) is 
c  written to the screen by the main "engine" module, currently 
c  bigmlt4.f.

c  Note that this module, along with idm2x3.f, id3x3.f, and shift5.f
c  are part of the new "engine", whose main module is bigmlt4.f.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x2.f							8/14/09


c  idm1x2 has the following changes from idm1x1:

c  1. The code for setting initial compartment amounts from initial
c  compartment concentrations is changed to reflect the fact that
c  now IC(2) refers to the index of the covariates, not the
c  column no. of RS (see comment in code).

c  2. The code to establish the timelag parameters has changed to
c  reflect that NTLAG(I) can now be negative --> in Subroutine
c  SHIFT, the associated timelag parameter will now be the 
c  exponent of the indicated parameter (rather than the parameter 
c  itself).

c  3. The code to establish the FA parameters has changed to
c  reflect that IFA(I) can now be negative --> the associated FA
c  parameter will now be the exponent of the indicated parameter 
c  (rather than the parameter itself).


c  idm1x2.f (along with other new modules idm2x2.f and idm3x2.f) are
c  still called by bigmlt2.f, but are part of the "engine" for the
c  new NPBIG15B.FOR program.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idm1x1.f							5/27/09


c  idm1x1.f has the following changes from idfix5g.f:

c  1. It allows the extra option of setting initial compartment 
c  amounts from their initial concentrations - see code in Subroutine 
c  FUNC. 

c  2. It is part of the new Big NPAG "engine", bigmlt2.f, which allows 
c  patient data files to have "reset" values of 0 in the dosage and 
c  sampling blocks. Whenever, in Subroutine FUNC, the program sees a 
c  SIG(.) = 0 and a TIM(.) = 0, it knows that a large enough time has 
c  passed since the last dose that all compartment amounts are to be 
c  reset = 0. Subsequent dose and observed value times are then values 
c  from this point.

c  3. The first argument to Subroutine OUTPUT is changed from 0.0 to 
c  0.D0 in two places.

c  This module, along with idm2x1.f and idm3x1.f are first used in the 
c  bigmlt2.f program.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idfix5g.f							5-28-02


c  idfix5g has the following changes from idfix5f.f:

c  It allows multiple drug inputs (rather than just one drug input).
c  The changes required for this are:

c  1. BS has dimension change from (500,3) to (500,7)
c  2. COMMON/CNST2 is changed to include NDRUG (no. of drugs) and
c     NADD (no. of additional covariates), rather than NBI and NRI.
c  3. NTLAG is now a vector instead of a scalar. In particular, 
C     NTLAG(I) = 0 IF DRUG I'S BOLUS COL. HAS NO TIMELAG PARAMETER;
C                K IF DRUG I'S BOLUS COL. HAS A TIMELAG WHOSE VALUE IS
C		   GIVEN BY PARAMETER NO K.
C  4. IFA, PASSED IN COMMON/FRABS FROM SUBROUTINE SYMBOL IS NOW A VECTOR
C     INSTEAD OF A SCALAR.
C     IFA(I) = 0 IF DRUG I WILL HAVE FA = 1.0.
C              K IF DRUG I WILL HAVE AN FA WHOSE VALUE IS TO BE GIVEN
C                BY PARAMETER K.
C  5. THE BOLUS COMPARTMENT NOS., NBCOMP(I), NOW COME VIA 
C     COMMON/BOLUSCOMP FROM SUBROUTINE SYMBOL, AND THE DIMENSION OF
C     NBCOMP HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 7 (MAXIMUM OF 1 PER DRUG) FROM 20.
C  6. ALL OF THE CODE IN SUBROUTINE FUNC RELATED TO NRI AND NBI HAS BEEN
C     CHANGED TO BE IN TERMS OF NI AND NDRUG. 
C  7. THE CODE RELATED TO CALLING SUBROUTINE SHIFT, INCLUDING THE 
C     CALLING ARGUMENTS, HAS BEEN CHANGED TO REFLECT THE ABOVE CHANGES
C     IN NTLAG (I.E., IT IS NOW A VECTOR RATHER THAN A SCALAR). A NEW
C     MODULE, shift3.f (WHICH REPLACES shift2.f) WILL BE LINKED WITH 
C     THIS MODULE.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idfix5f.f							4-23-02

c  idfix5f has the following changes to idfix5e:

c  1. To enable FA to be a parameter value (either fixed or random), 
c  rather than always be hardcoded = 1.0, the following changes are
c  implemented ...

c  The hardcoding of FA = 1.0 and the code for NBCOMP are removed
c  from main. In addition, COMMON/BCOMP is removed from the entire 
c  module. Instead, in SUBROUTINE FUNC, a new COMMON/FRABS/IFA provides 
c  the value IFA which is the parameter index of the FA value (passed
c  from SUBROUTINE SYMBOL) unless it = 0, in which case FA is
c  set = 1.0. Also the NBCOMP compartment nos. are now set in 
c  SUBROUTINE FUNC.

c  2. COMMONS /OBSER AND /SUM2 (and the arrays in them) are deleted from 

c  main. They were not needed. Also, COMMON CNST2 is deleted from main
c  since NBI is no longer needed here (since NBCOMP code is removed -
c  see no. 1. above).

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------

c  idfix5e.f							1-22-00

c  idfix5e has the following changes to idfix5d:

c  It allows the initial conditions of the amounts in the compartments
c  to be paramater values, rather than fixed at 0.0. These parameter
c  values may be either fixed or random.


c  To affect this enhancement, the primary change is the code in 
c  subroutine FUNC which sets the initial conditions based on the 
c  values in IC which are provided by COMMON/INITCOND from 
c  SUBROUTINE SYMBOL of the Fortran model file.

c  There are many other changes to simply the code (i.e., a lot of
c  code was leftover code which was unused and/or confusing), namely:

c  - Commons ADAPT1, ADAPT2, LPARAM, PRED, TRANS, and PARAM are 

c    deleted. Variables ISW, IP, and C are deleted.
c  - COMMON/PARAMD/P is now in MAIN, FUNC, and JACOB; MAIN and
c    FUNCx of idcy_53e.f and idcy_63e.f; and DIFFEQ and OUTPUT of
c    the Fortran model file.
c  - P is redimensioned 32. It will hold only the parameters of the
c    model (although some of those parameters may be initial conditions)
c    and there are 20 allowable random paramaters and 12 allowable
c    fixed paramaters now.
c  - All the code to reverse the paramater order (using PD) and to do
c    and undo square root transformations in MAIN and FUNC is removed
c    (it was unneeded, and therefore confusing). In particular, all
c    references to NPT, NUMYES, NUIC, NUP, NPNL, and NBOT are removed.
c  - COMMON ANALYT/IDIFF is removed. IDIFF is unneeded since IDIFF = 0
c    is equivalent to N = 0, and so IDIFF code in FUNC is replaced by
c    the equivalent code for N. NEQN is replaced by N.

c  - In SUBROUTINE SUMSQ, COMMON/PARAM is removed, along with PP and P.
c    Setting PP(I) = P(I), I=1,NPNL made no sense since PP wasn't used

c    and NPNL was always = 0 anyway. P is removed as an argument to
c    SUMSQ (it was unneeded).
c  - In FUNC, the If statment at label 83 is changed to include N .EQ. 0
c    since if N = 0, setting compartment values is unnecessary.


c  idfix5e is part of the big npem program, npbig4.f.

C  THE LOGIC OF THIS CODE IS TAKEN FROM PROGRAM DESOLV3.FOR (4/28/96).

C  FOLLOWING VALUES ARE SUPPLIED TO SUBROUTINE DVODE:

C  DIFFEQ  = NAME OF SUBROUTINE COMPLETED BY USER WHICH GIVES THE D.E.'S 
C	     OF THE MODEL. IT MUST BE DECLARED EXTERNAL.
C TIN      = The initial value of the independent variable.

C TOUT   = First point where output is desired (.ne. TIN). 
C ITOL   = 2 SINCE ATOL IS AN ARRAY.
C RTOL   = Relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = Absolute tolerance parameter.
C          The estimated local error in X(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(X(i)) + ATOL(i)  SINCE ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution.. Actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of X at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = Integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional input used.
C RWORK  = Real work array of length at least..
C             20 + 16*NDIM                      for MF = 10,
C             22 +  9*NDIM + 2*NDIM**2           for MF = 21 or 22,

C	... I'LL USE AN ARRAY OF 300 (PLENTY FOR NDIM .LE. 8).
C LRW    = Declared length of RWORK (in user's DIMENSION statement).
C IWORK  = Integer work array of length at least..
C             30        for MF = 10,
C             30 + NDIM  for MF = 21, 22, 24, or 25.
C          If MF = 24 or 25, input in IWORK(1),IWORK(2) the lower
C          and upper half-bandwidths ML,MU.
C	... I'LL USE AN ARRAY OF 40 (PLENTY FOR NDIM .LE. 8).
C LIW    = Declared length of IWORK (in user's DIMENSION).
C JACOB    = Name of subroutine COMPLETED BY USER for Jacobian matrix 
C	     (MF = 21 or 24). If used, this name must be declared 
C	     external.  If not used, pass a dummy name.
C MF     = Method flag.  Standard values are..
C          10 for nonstiff (Adams) method, no Jacobian used.
C          21 for stiff (BDF) method, user-supplied full Jacobian.
C          22 for stiff method, internally generated full Jacobian.

C          24 for stiff method, user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C          25 for stiff method, internally generated banded Jacobian.
C RPAR,IPAR = user-defined real and integer SCALARS OR arrays passed to 
C	      DIFFEQ AND JACOB.

C Note that the main program must declare arrays X, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL, RPAR, and IPAR.


C  THE FOLLOWING VALUES RETURN FROM CALLS TO SUBROUTINE DVODE.

C      X = Array of computed values of X vector (AT TIME TOUT).
C      T = Corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DVODE was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call. (Perhaps wrong MF.)
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested. (Tolerances too small.)
C          -3 means illegal input detected. (See printed message.)
C          -4 means repeated error test failures. (Check all input.)
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures. (Perhaps bad
C             Jacobian supplied or wrong choice of MF or tolerances.)
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
