# Pmetrics 
Thank you for your interest in Pmetrics. Pmetrics is a library package for R to perform non-parametric and parametric pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic population and individual modeling and simulation. It is primarily designed for pharmacometric researchers.

Pmetrics is based on over 35 years of research by our laboratory and is the most mature non-parametric method available. Nevertheless, Pmetrics is dynamically evolving. Best of all, it is SHAREWARE with only a suggested donation.

More information about Pmetrics is available at the [Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and Bioinformatics](http://www.lapk.org/Pmetrics.php).

## Installation

In R, you can install Pmetrics from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LAPKB/Pmetrics")
```
